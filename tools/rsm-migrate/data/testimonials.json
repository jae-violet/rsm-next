But, the most natural fit for my work, the firm which stood apart as possessing the most alluring elixir of creative and professional engagement, was RSM Design. A highly collaborative firm, collegial, impossible to rattle with severe criticism, they always led with optimism and interest. To a person they bring a level of energy, excitement, curiosity, and creativity rarely exhibited by environmental design professionals. Their passion is infectious, and the outcome shows it. They are consummate professionals.</p>",

Sharing our findings with our key stakeholders with RSM remains one of the most effective community meetings we have held. Their plan provides us with a contextually sensitive design that is extremely attractive to our donors and to the city’s parks and recreation department. It sets the standard now for the entire park and is influencing system-wide donor recognition, advancing design from pedestrian to best-in-class.</p>",
