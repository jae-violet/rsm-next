    "overview": "<h2>WBE design studio specializing in branding, wayfinding &amp; placemaking</h2><p>RSM Design is proud to be a WBE wayfinding &amp; graphic design studio working in placemaking, branding &amp; environmental graphic design. RSM Design is a collection of diverse designers who look deeply and pull surrounding cues to connect people to place, and those people to each other. As a WBE graphic design studio our branding and logo design is finely tuned, well crafted, and captures the spirit while making a statement. Through experiential graphic design we seamlessly integrate the brand into architecture &amp; landscape creating a wayfinding signage system &amp; master plan built on the values determined by client, community or stakeholders. We work for the wow, whether dramatic or subtle, and most importantly we work for people with vision.</p><p>RSM Design is a certified Women Business Enterprise (WBE) and is certified nationally by the National Women Business Owners Corporation. As well, we are certified WBE in the state of Texas by the Texas Unified Certification Program and North Central Texas Regional Certification Agency.
