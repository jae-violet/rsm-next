As the Executive Director of the firm, Harry works at this intersection of architecture and graphics and leads the projects and teams to understand the importance of and the symbiotic relationship between graphics and signage within the built environment. His work has helped transform difficult user experiences in buildings, adding a layer of clarity and organization with unexpected graphic interventions.</p><p>Early in Harry’s career he honed his design and graphic sensibilities while working internationally as an Associate with RTKL and as a Senior Associate with HOK Architects. Additionally, before focusing his career in the environmental graphics realm, Harry established an independent architecture and graphics studio in Dallas, Texas, focusing on unique design interventions at a smaller scale. As a respected author and frequent speaker on industry issues and the recipient of numerous design awards, Harry’s designs and written articles have been published in several national magazines and journals and featured in exhibits throughout the United States. In 2015 Harry was elected to The College of Fellows of The American Institute of Architects. The Jury of Fellows cited Harry’s “notable contributions to the advancement of the profession of architecture.”</p><p>Harry earned his Bachelor of Architecture from The University of Texas at Austin and a Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Arts. Harry has been a registered architect for over 25 years, and an active member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Harry is the editor of the architecture and community publication of the city of Dallas, Columns Magazine, and the co-founder, current publisher, and editor-in-chief for the design publication, Architype Review. Additionally, for the past 24 years Harry has been the senior architect at the Aphrodisias Archaeological Excavations in Turkey for Oxford University and New York University, spending each summer directing and teaching a team of graduate students in documenting and reconstructing classical antiquities.</p>",
