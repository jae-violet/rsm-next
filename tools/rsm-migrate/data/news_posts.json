For the first half of the day the slow cookers heated up their culinary masterpieces. The rich aroma of chili wafted through the air and stomachs churned and growled while awaiting tasting time.</p><p>Are you getting hungry yet?</p><p>Finally at noon the cornbread arrived (Thanks Valerie &amp; Kathy!) and the tasting battle began. Each of the 4 chilis was incredibly tasty with unique flavors and ingredients that set it apart from the others. Ashley’s secret weapon of choice was chocolate, mmmm chocolate, making her chili delectable. DJ made a white chili, fragrant with herbs and spices that set it apart not only visually but was scrumptious as well. Kelly created a hot and fiery Creole chili, complete with andouille sausage, brown ale and 13 blazing spices that gave it quite a kick. Kyle (also known as “Chili Cook-Off Champ ’08) cooked up a hearty All-American style chili which brought out the best of a sausage and ground sirloin combo that would make any cowboy’s mouth water.</p><p>It was the toughest decision in years (all 2 of them) with each chili being so different yet so darn yummy. After seconds and thirds were taken, the votes were cast and tallied and Kelly’s spicy Creole chili was named the 2009 winner. Now that’s HOT!</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f63ae40c4a60a94075ae2dc_n02_RSM-Design-2nd-Annual-Chili-Cookoff_poster.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure>"

These obstacles are shaping communities' responses to development, design, and ultimately the creation of healthy and meaningful spaces to gather, reconnect and rebuild lives. <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/about\">‍</a></p><p><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/about\">As a people-focused team of designers</a>, we believe that our mission is to work sensitively with communities, developers and dreamers to craft engaging brands that foster meaning for their audiences. </p><p>Now looking to reboot our economies, communities, and environments, we must first identify the essential design principles that get brands back on track. <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/team/suzanne-redmond-schwartz\">Suzanne Redmond Schwartz</a> and <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/team/cody-clark\">Cody Clark</a>, Principals and <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/services/branding-logo-design\">brand design</a> experts at RSM Design, have teamed up for a conversation on how to build a strong brand.<strong> </strong>‍</p><p>How you discover your brand requires an in-depth process of examining several components of your story. These essential pieces to your brand strategy are: your vision, audience, mission, core values, and personality. </p><h2>1. Uncovering An Authentic Brand Vision<br></h2><p>A vision is no longer an afterthought. Today, it’s an essential first step in explaining your promise to your market. This means that the thoughtful and impactful brands stand out. These brands ultimately drive positive market positioning, loyalty, and economic success. </p><p>To begin the brand process, it is critical that you articulate what your organization stands for. We believe that “beginning with the end in mind” your team must ask those big questions to evaluate and ultimately define your DNA.</p><p>At our branding firm, we tackle this inside-out<em> </em>process by engaging the community through surveying experiences and leading a guided conversation. Establishing a clear vision is the first step towards a sustainable and engaging brand.&nbsp;</p><p>Located in Los Angeles, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/hhla\">HHLA</a> is an iconic venue for entertainment. The vision for this project was rooted in crafting a destination designed for foodies, film buffs, families, tourists and adventure seekers. By first creating the groundwork for the brand story, our team was then able to transform HHLA into a branded environment that speaks to the life and culture of Los Angeles.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f6e205138811f3180740458_n10_RSM-Design_HHLA.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f6e2056d9172dcb73784bca_n11_RSM-Design_HHLA.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/60f5cd35c3d896e8d03d8e18_RSM-Design_HHLA-Placemaking.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>HHLA in Los Angeles, California</figcaption></figure><h2>2. &nbsp;Captivate your Target Audience</h2><p>Behind every great brand experience is a loyal following. A powerful brand is a mirror that reflects your market. Defining your audience allows you to position a brand in a voice that directly appeals to a group’s desires and needs. </p><p>There are several factors to consider about an audience including: age, gender, income, values, lifestyle, and other organizations they connect with. In our team’s experience, individuals often gravitate towards brands that have a unique character and a strong point-of-view. People prefer brands that they can identify with at a deeper level.</p><p>Recently, our design team worked alongside the University of California, San Diego to craft a visual brand and logo design for <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/hospitality-information?s=1\">Hospitality Information</a>. The project’s mission is to make life easier for the university community by providing access and tools to students, faculty and guests on campus with day-to-day questions. Essentially, they wanted to turn the concierge service into a branded experience.</p><p>By utilizing a people-centered design approach, this allowed the design team to navigate the complexity of such a service. With a specific attention on the community, the identity design for the service emerged by focusing on clarity. Implementing branded touch points encourage guest interaction and speak directly to the audience.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/600a19246cefcfe705854651_RSM-Design_Hospitality-Information_UC-San-Diego_Logo-Lockers.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/600a1a5adc2fe9d2b10404c7_RSM-Design_Hospitality-Information_UC-San-Diego_Logo-laptop.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Hospitality Information at University of California, San Diego</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Define Your Organization’s Mission </h2><p>In order to create a brand that has meaning and relevance, it’s vital to understand your mission statement. What is the <em>why</em> behind what you do?</p><p>Our team is working on the branding behind the new Petersburg Park. The park stretches beyond simply being a piece of the landscape. It’s desire is to serve as a brand experience that reimagines what the city’s fabric and community will look like for future generations. It’s an inspiring place that honors people of all economic status and cultural backgrounds.</p><p>In the early days the site was home to a thriving neighborhood. But in the 1980’s, residents and business owners were evicted, and the entire community was bulldozed for the development of a baseball stadium. Since 2016, The City of St. Petersburg has been working on plans to redevelop the area once again. This time with a different goal in mind: honor the place’s past and restore a destroyed community. </p><p>By understanding the organization’s mission, our team is able to create a visual identity that clearly communicates the brand story and in turn develops brand awareness. Utilizing <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/services/environmental-graphic-design\">environmental graphic design</a> and signage applications that reflect the identity system, the park will be transformed from an abandoned site to a landmark rich with culture.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.25%\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.25%\" data-rt-dimensions=\"640:360\" data-page-url=\"https://vimeo.com/543258322\"><div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/543258322\"></iframe></div></figure><h2>4. Define Your Brand Beliefs And Values</h2><p>Brand values are the foundational principles on which a company stands. Your core values should ultimately reflect your brand mission. This allows your brand to become memorable and consistent, as well, it also builds trust and enables brand loyalty. </p><p>In Southern California, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/liberty-station-san-diego-ca\">Liberty Station</a> is a living brand that has held true to its core values since the beginning of its time. Grounded in military tradition, the San Diego site was first developed as a Naval Training Center. Today, Liberty Station thrives as a revitalized place for the community to gather, dine, shop, and engage with art. It is also a space to honor the destination’s historical story.&nbsp;</p><p>Our team worked to create an identity package which reflects the project’s values and inspires the neighborhood. By identifying three main core values (History, Future, and Community) the design team crafted a set of graphic symbols that ultimately blended to create the visual logo mark. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f6b8e24bd554c3cf644efb2_b04_RSM-Design_Liberty-Station_Branding.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f6b8e32c366bb219028153a_b05a_RSM-Design_Liberty-Station_Logo-stamp.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/60f5ce424dd66501de72b7b8_RSM-Design_Liberty-Station_Sign-Detail.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/60f5ce4d5a0f3724a250cfaa_RSM-Design_Liberty-Station-Sign.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Liberty Station in San Diego, California</figcaption></figure><h2>5. &nbsp;Live Out Your Brand’s Personality<strong>‍</strong></h2><blockquote><strong>“Design transforms bricks, glass and concrete into a place with soul and style.” </strong></blockquote><h6><strong>‍</strong><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/book/graphic-connections-in-architecture\"><strong>RSM Design, Graphic Connections in Architecture</strong></a>‍</h6><p>Lastly, is how you define your personality. Our tip? Keep it authentic.&nbsp;</p><p>This piece of the puzzle creates a framework for guiding your organization closer towards your mission and therefore your audience. It engages your community in a way that sparks an emotional response.&nbsp;</p><p>Personality can then be translated to the physical space for a greater brand recognition, through applications such as <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/services/placemaking\">placemaking</a>, programming, and marketing. These elements allow your guests to feel connected and delighted. </p><p>Proud to be bold in flavor and story, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/bearded-tang-brewery\">Bearded Tang Brewery</a> captures the essence of personality. Their narrative is about three friends with a passion for creating great beer and a desire to share it with their community.</p><p>Our team developed an illustrative logo that is both quirky and humorous as it is refined. The overall brand identity design is targeted towards creating an enjoyable connection with guests. Today, the brewery in Orange County has created its own following and guests are equally as excited about the brand as its founders are.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/60f5ce87aaba05d5ac8211a0_RSM-Design_Bearded-Tang-Brewery_logo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6039883ba4a68d020fee7e61_RSM-Design_Bearded-Tang-Brewery_People-holding-beer.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6039893c047ee1cc492cf77d_RSM-Design_Bearded-Tang-Brewery_Beer-can4.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Bearded Tang Brewery in Stanton, California</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, successful brands are built upon insights and strategy that drive the visual language. Developing a clear strategy is essential to positioning your brand and authentically engaging with your audience. </p><p>With the disruption of society caused by the pandemic, many of us are looking towards the future with a desire for renewed connection. We’re looking for new ways to relate to our communities, workplaces, the spaces we inhabit and brands we choose to live alongside. Finding our identity in this new world will require diligent work and an internal check on who we are, similar to how brands and organizations will continue to evolve. </p><p>It’s exciting to imagine where this sense of discovery will take us. But what’s truly next for brands? It's simple: first, take a look inside. <br></p>"

On their return trip from Abu Dhabi (to present the concept identity designs for Ferrari World) the two did a bit of marketing and interviewed for a new exciting project in Cairo – will get back to you on that project. Then, they took advantage of a lengthy layover in London to search again for the origins of mystical environmental graphics at Stonehenge. There are advantages to layovers at Heathrow after all! So, you must be wondering…..did they find the origins of environmental graphics?</p>"

Large scale architectural branding included not only the name and logo evolution and creation, but also the implementation of this in large scale signs such as the one placed on the historic ore crane. Micro level branding culminated in the Sands &amp; Co. retail shop, the premier merchandise store for the Sands Corporation, where branding was concepted, designed and implemented by RSM.

We have recently explored how the signage and <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/placemaking-public-art/\">placemaking</a> needs on <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/higher-education-design/\">university and college campuses</a> are a microcosm of this broader context and that a few key ideas about the role of signage builds stronger brands and positive student experiences.</p><p>As our team approaches the wayfinding and signage needs within the world of higher education, we start by identifying what connections are most important to the design problem at hand. Prospective students want clarity, while returning students, faculty, and staff value an integrated approach in tune with the campus culture. This might seem like a balancing act, but by remaining true to the core brand both goals can be met simultaneously. With placemaking on campus, as with many other <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/wayfinding-design/\">wayfinding</a> challenges, the key is to give students the right information at the right time.</p><h3><strong>CERTAINTY AT ARRIVAL </strong> </h3><p>When visitors step onto the campus for the first time, they are building important early impressions of that branded experience. Signs are the metaphorical front door of the campus— naming the place, and linking the mental image to the physical reality of the space. Based on the clarity and quality of that message, expectations are met and new expectations are created.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f494465bcbedeb6a9fabdc8_n02-RSM-Design-Campus-Placemaking_SantaAnaCollege.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Monument sign at Santa Ana College (Santa Ana, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p>RSM Design’s work in campus signage master plans and student unions best illustrate this approach. Signs should amplify the existing brand, architecture and values of the campus. For example, when RSM Design first arrived on the <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/santa-ana-college-santa-ana-ca/\">Santa Ana College</a> campus to begin a new wayfinding program there was no signage on the campus exterior. The subsequent design of the sign program became an expression of community and campus pride— an invitation to the campus that spoke to the city at large. The design brought the voice of the campus out in a visible way, reaching out to the neighborhood, while respecting the Spanish revival style of the campus architecture. The addition of high contrast letters and brightly colored mosaics act as an invitation to the community with a clear sense of the brand and roots of the campus.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4946a38fed3a79516fcad9_n03-RSM-Design-Campus-Placemaking_CollegeoftheDesert.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Monument signage at College of the Desert (Palm Desert, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Another example, the<a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/college-of-the-desert-palm-desert-california/\"> College of the Desert’s</a> sign program started with the modernist roots of the campus, complementing a diverse set of applications through its simplicity. RSM Design created a cohesive approach, to visually connect a campus built over time. Sign materials were selected to withstand the harsh desert climate and the consistent font and size standards allow for flexibility as the campus grows.<br></p><h3><strong>LAYERED AND BALANCED EXPERIENCE</strong></h3><p>The social and emotional connections to campuses run deep and are built over time. For the students, faculty, and staff, there is a sense of pride and community that defines higher education as a special place. RSM Design’s work on the University of California Riverside campus and its <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/university-of-california-riverside/\">Highlander Union Building</a> shows the power of signage to symbolize community. One &nbsp;of the first evolutions we suggested was an acronym for the union building (HUB) and a large iconic statement of the UCR identity. The new HUB letters wrap the architectural tower, optimizing sight lines and expressing the vibrant nature of the building within the overall campus.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4958e136df89aaf273a9b5_n04-RSM-Design-Campus-Placemaking_UCRHub-2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>The Highlander Union Building identity signage (UC-Riverside, Riverside, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Across the plaza are the eight foot tall UCR identity letters. These heroic letters have become an important icon on the campus, with countless photos taken every year by student clubs, teams, graduates, and their families. This installation has become a place to express campus pride, making that intangible emotional connection tangible. At graduation, the letters are so popular that the campus sets up a rope to contain the lines of students waiting to have their photos taken. These photos and the sharing of them has become an important part of the UCR student experience.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4965c60009dd80a3688a08_n05-RSM-Design-Campus-Placemaking_UCRHub-3.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>The large scale letters in the middle of the UC-Riverside campus (Riverside, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the opposite end of this spectrum another project, the <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/mesa-court-towers-irvine-ca/\">Mesa Court Towers at the University of California Irvine</a> – &nbsp;an on-campus undergraduate residential district with housing, dining, student services, mail, and lounge spaces. Working closely with <a href=\"http://mithun.com/\">Mithun Architects</a>, RSM Design carefully wove signage into the development, matching architectural finishes and a softer sensibility in line with the crafted nature of the building. Wayfinding elements link students to important locations and amenities, as well as the campus at large without dominating the spaces. Large-scale super graphics illustrate the building names on colors derived from the architectural palette.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4965f30009dd811368ad64_n06-RSM-Design-Campus-Placemaking_Mesa-Court.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Directional signage as well as a glimpse at one of the supergraphics in the lobby of one of the residential buildings (UCI Mesa Court, Irvine, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at these two very different solutions shows RSM Design’s principle of layering and balance. Each set of graphics is tailored to the problem at hand and thoughtful enough to withstand the test of time.</p><h3><strong>TOWN AND GOWN</strong></h3><p>An additional topic to address with campus wayfinding are solutions that bridge the gap with the surrounding community. At the <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/university-of-the-pacific/\">University of the Pacific’s Dugoni School of Dentistry</a>, the challenge was to create an inviting interior space for a diverse international and local community for their dental work. The client originally wanted orange to reflect the campus branded colors, but the dental school recognized the need for a calming, cool color palette. To find common ground, the orange was used on the exterior identity signs to connect to the university brand, while on the interior more cool colors are used as graphic accents.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f496612571ab37b59fa0727_n07-RSM-Design-Campus-Placemaking_Univ-of-Pac-1.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>University of the Pacific’s brand orange color on the exterior signage of the building (Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Dental work can be a stressful time for many patients, especially when navigating across language and cultural barriers. RSM Design worked closely with the campus to use a light and open approach to signage with a hint of color. The color makes the space inviting and non-threatening wherever possible. Crisp type and clean lines communicate the world class cutting edge nature of the institution and the precise work done there by students. International icons replace type, creating directionals to communicate more universally to the users. The campus is a serious location doing important work, but must also reach a hand out to the community invite first time users.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f496636e99f74deae56e320_n08-RSM-Design-Campus-Placemaking_Univ-of-Pac-2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>The interior of the building featuring a much calmer and cooler color palette (University of the Pacific Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, CA)</em><br></figcaption></figure><p>The solution to all of these RSM Design graphics projects centers around the premise of remaining true to the campus while working to provide necessary information.

They are meaningful in their functionality but what we’re after as a design studio is creating something that’s transformational, how do we create spaces that help people connect and have meaningful experiences. We want to add to their lives, create pride, ownership, and longevity. Our goal at RSM is to design experiences that enrich every part of daily life. People’s experiences are always at the core of what we do, we create connections, activations, and relevancy. We always work within the bounds of who we’re designing for, the context and the conditions. We are writing the recipe for designing to a specific narrative of a project. A recipe that creates impactful and transformational experiences for the range of people that are going to visit each project. There are many contexts that designers are faced with on a daily basis, I am going to talk about five of the core contexts and show projects for each of these.</p><h2>Cultural Context</h2><h3>The BAR Center at the Beach</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2600px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/640295f9f566121baff85d31_63effcfab77841012cac1fd0_Hero_TheBarCenteratTheBeach-p-2600.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">The BAR Center at the beach in Venice, California was an existing center from the 1960s that was built for the Jewish community of Los Angeles. The Jewish Federation of Los Angeles is part of a nationwide Foundation whose goal is to share knowledge about Jewish heritage and serves a lot of different functions for the community. We worked to create graphics and a typographic language that can celebrate the culture of the Federation. While communicating the brand of the building it also wanted to be slightly ambiguous, an abstract interpretation. The Star of David was separated into an abstracted graphic form where it becomes deconstructed. We used it as a graphic patterning device that became a veil around the building. This is not a building where you want to have a screaming loud identity so we looked at taking advantage of light. A Jerusalem stone was imported for the project so routing out the monogram with only the natural environment for illumination is the contextual feel this project needed.</p><h6><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/the-bar-center-at-the-beach\">The BAR Center at the Beach Project Page</a></h6><h3>The Buddy Holly Hall of Performing Arts and Sciences</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1312px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1312px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6402970b3c89a46210284f28_Screen%20Shot%202023-03-03%20at%2011.38.37%20AM.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Buddy Holly Hall of Performing Arts and Sciences is in West Texas. We started by building the right typography for the traditional signage of the project but a big effort was creating these amazing experiences within the project. Donor installations are a great storytelling device and in this case we worked closely with the architect. We ended up filling the atrium space with volumetric guitar picks at different scales for different gifting amounts. When you step back this donor wall becomes an image of Buddy Holly on guitar. There’s a symbiotic relationship between the graphic narrative and the architecture, the two are designed together.</p><h6><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/buddy-holly-hall-lubbock-texas\">The Buddy Holly Hall Project Page</a></h6><h2>Architectural Context</h2><h3>The Drew</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/640296b09d8878b8f9b96304__RSM-Design_The-Drew-Music-Hall.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">The Drew Las Vegas was going to be a 6 million square foot building with a hotel, casino, retail, restaurants, among other things. Our approach collectively between consultants was to look at it very differently from a storytelling point of view. There has to be a functionality to it that helps the guest experience but you also want to pair that with discovery and surprise. You want to create something that’s memorable. We built on the idea of ground, horizon, sky and how everybody’s association with a space is in one of these three categories. How do we leverage each one of those moments paired with the information, art or media that needs to happen at that particular location. We had the freedom to control how information is woven through the environment, it doesn’t have to be static, it can be digital, it can be ever-changing. Information would disappear and then reappear as it was needed. We wanted things to be surprising and artful so information disappears when there’s no one around and it transforms into art. Then the minute someone is in proximity it turns to the necessary wayfinding information. We were able to rethink how people engaged with typography in really interesting ways.</p><h2>Historical Context</h2><h3>Fifth &amp; Broadway</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6402980199703d81fd5f912c_5th%26B.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Fifth and Broadway is in downtown Nashville on the north side of Broadway, across from the Ryman Auditorium and Bridgestone Arena. We wanted to celebrate the old honky tonks, saloons, and music venues that line Broadway. We do a lot of research to extract a vocabulary of typography, color palettes, and materials that don’t feel foreign to the context. This is clearly a new place, but it’s a place that honors its past.</p><h6><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/fifth-and-broadway\">Fifth &amp; Broadway Project Page</a></h6><h2>Motivational Context</h2><h3>Platform One @ UnCommons</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6008b685172428f331ace26d_RSM-Design_Platform_One-Uncommons_Brand-Guidelines.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Platform One is a food Hall that’s part of a larger project on the outskirts of Las Vegas. We did a deep dive on research locally and developed this brand inspired by hobo symbols. There’s a long-standing iconography study of hobo symbols in American culture, we leveraged that to create something more cryptic and uniquely this place. The symbology creates ambiguity, which creates a question, which prompts a story. In this case the applications celebrate individualism, the client even sold t-shirts where everybody could create their own combination of symbols. The brand ultimately changes for each person, they get to apply their personal interpretation of the place. As a transmedia designer we’re assessing how to tell a similar story across multiple platforms. You have to build this diversity of brand and typography that lives in a lot of different contexts within multiple experiences.</p><h6><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/platform-one-at-uncommons\">Platform One Project Page</a></h6><h2>Density Context</h2><h3>Post District</h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61f314ba0591e5dea13043ac_Image14.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Density is a really important context because it sets the tone and recipe for the right visual voice for a given market. Post District is an adaptive reuse project in downtown Salt Lake City. The main building on site was the old newspaper printing facility for the Salt Lake City News. Uncertainty was really important, we wanted to design spaces that felt eclectic. We talked a lot about texture and applying that to different areas of the space. We deconstructed the brand typographically so it would never be seen the same way twice. It was stamped into surfaces and architecture as texture within the environment. It allowed us the freedom to use the brand in vague ways that enhance the experience holistically while maintaining the feel.</p><h6><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/post-district-salt-lake-city\">Post District Project Page</a></h6><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p>"

More than simply decorating a space, environmental graphic design is critical to establishing the purpose of a space, the visitor’s place within it, and helping to shape the overall experience.

Subtleties in design can have a huge impact. A different typeface can completely change the vibe of a place. A well-placed bench can bring moments of comfort and joy. A cool <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/placemaking-public-art/\" id=\"\">mural</a> or graphic can inspire selfies to share with others. These are the emotional connections that drive people, the unconscious aspects that create resonance and transform a simple visit into a dynamic and memorable experience.

And the community questioned what had happened. Visitors had identified with the artwork so strongly that they asked the developer to bring them back. Shortly after, the murals became permanent installations.</p><blockquote id=\"\">What was intended to be a temporary expression of Huntington Beach’s culture was embraced and permanently adopted by the community. The murals used graphics in architecture to communicate the area’s history and spirit. What seemed like a temporary fix turned out to be something completely beloved.</blockquote><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6154c9021d8da5b9aa8ee4d4_New-Pacific-City_RSM_design.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/60f75deadd4dea7fb9d6f399_RSM-Design_Pacific-City.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Looking Forward: The Evolutions of Digital Experience Design</h2><p id=\"\">Given how today’s graphics in architecture and wayfinding design trend toward community-focused context, culture, and emotion, what does that tell us about where things are going? Can we accurately predict the future of architectural graphics and wayfinding?</p><p id=\"\">No, but it sure is fun to speculate.</p><p id=\"\">It all comes down to the individual. Many people seem to be attached to their smartphones—it’s how they navigate. Will “traditional” forms of wayfinding be as critical in the future with our reliance on the digital expansion?</p><p id=\"\">Digital components in signage are not new…they have been around for quite some time, so that’s not what we’re talking about. It’s more about how wayfinding and graphics will become greater user focused. We will be exploring how wayfinding will become more intuitive and less reliant on traditional signage methods, instead turning to virtual engagement of the space.</p><p id=\"\">We’re seeing how signage technology is shifting. For example, we're using technology that produces LED glass or digital nodes to transform any surface...into a sign, an image, a pattern, another façade. We're seeing digital graphic façades that generate their own power or other sustainable initiatives, becoming more multi-functional and more inherent with the architectural expression.<br></p><blockquote id=\"\">Will all of this outdo traditional models of wayfinding? Most likely not. Instead, it will enhance them. As buildings become digitally smarter, they will inherently evolve to do more, but we will always use the graphic layer of buildings to convey culture, community, and context.</blockquote><h2 id=\"\">Next: The Future of Environmental Graphic Design</h2><p id=\"\">Right now, culturally, it feels like we’re in a similar spot when compared to the country after the 1918 flu pandemic, which ushered in the roaring 20s. With the anticipation of a reopening and return to normalcy, people are looking for comfort and confidence, while also craving new experiences. How will this change the impact of environmental graphics and experience design?</p><p id=\"\">It starts by blending smart technology with wayfinding in a way that helps people feel comfortable about getting back and learning how to experience travel, dining out, and being with the community again. We’ll get back to digging into the future of graphics in architecture in the third installment of this series.

The premise is that there is one great park, and then each individual park, such as <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/cadence-park-irvine-ca\"><strong>Cadence Park</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/pavilion-park-irvine-ca\"><strong>Pavilion Park</strong></a>, where the neighborhoods are built around, are also great.</p><p>Each time they build a new neighborhood they put a park in the middle. They build the model homes right on the edge so the park becomes the hub and spokes. They have cooking and painting classes, kite making, pumpkin carving and all kinds of events in these community parks.</p><p>RSM Design has completed the signage and wayfinding for all of these events as well as the permanent signage and several placemaking elements that define what different areas of the space are to be used for. It definitely connects the community in a classic, almost town square kind of way. <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/great-park-neighborhoods\"><br></a></p><h2><strong>Defining the Outdoor Experience</strong></h2><p>Each park has a different monument and wayfinding signage system along with a unique play structure that pays careful attention to the curated park design. Whether it's <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/the-pools-irvine-ca\"><strong>the community pool ar</strong>ea</a> and the graphics and signage related to pools, or perhaps a garden theme park or an art walk, the environmental graphics and park signage design speak to different elements that serve the community’s particular needs.</p><blockquote>These opportunities for <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/service/experiential-design\"><strong>experiential graphic desig</strong>n</a> and public art programs relate to the essence of each parks' individual personality and bring out that character in a form that people can see and read. It gives the place a spirit that it might not have otherwise.</blockquote><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5ff605a85a78507f49f6deec_RSM-Design_Environmental-Graphic-Design-Outdoors_Cadence-Park-Irvine.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5ff605b8629b906ebacaa41e_RSM-Design_Environmental-graphic-design-outdoors-Cadence-Park-Irvine2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/cadence-park-irvine-ca\">Cadence Park</a> at Great Park Neighborhoods, Irvine, California<br></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Connecting to a Living Brand</strong></h2><p>Great Park Neighborhoods is the Anti-Brand, meaning they don't really say “Great Park Neighborhoods” anywhere. They just do great parks and neighborhoods. The living brand has a breath of its own. For each of the parks, it’s a unique <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/services/master-sign-programs\"><strong>master signage system</strong></a><strong> </strong>all across the area that is creating the identity.</p><blockquote>What people are engaging with in those spaces is due to the different narratives that belong to each park. The signage and wayfinding design provide aesthetic cues. Each park is identified uniquely by creating fun ways to make them different from the other parks. The signage and identifiers play a unique part in that.</blockquote><p>In contrast, there is a different approach for the<a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/the-summit-bechtel-reserve\"> <strong>Summit at Bechtel Reserve</strong></a> for the Boy Scouts of America. It's definitely a branded experience. Everything feels like a kit of parts that work together. Whether it's a stop sign waiting for the shuttle or a map, each piece has a related look and feel. Everything is a branded destination or experience, whether it's the skateboard park or the biking or archery area.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5ff6060fde0fe909c40cdbac_RSM-Design_Environmental-Graphic-design-outdoors-The-Summit.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/the-summit-bechtel-reserve\">Summit Bechtel Reserve</a>, Mt. Hope, WV<br></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Engaging Elements of the Human Experience: Connect, Activate, Think, Inspire</strong></h2><p>You're on a corner in Chicago and your friend says to meet you at that big red sculpture. You're waiting, looking up at this big red sculpture and someone comes up to you. One person says, “Do you know the artist?”, and the other person says, “Yes, it's Calder.”</p><p>What’s great about these places and moments is they can be appreciated by both one or many, inviting strangers to have a conversation and connect. The art invites a place for conversations to spark, because two people that don't know each other are both looking up at this red sculpture.</p><p>It also activates the space, like a poem in the pavement. It makes you think about what the poem says. Or maybe it's an educational plaque about trees, or it might be the history of the place. You might have an educational moment or an inspirational moment to connect to one another or to connect to nature.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5ff6064e2533d5c153295333_RSM-Design_Environmental-graphic-design-outdoors-Monet-avenue.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/monet-avenue-rancho-cucamonga-ca\">Monet Avenue</a>, Rancho Cucamonga, California<br></figcaption></figure><p>An example for Inspire is when you hike to the top of a mountain or hilltop. At the top, there's a graphic that shows all of the mountains nearby and you learn the elevation of not only the one you're standing on, but the ones that you can see in the distance. You become inspired to hike a different mountain and then maybe that inspires you to climb Mount Whitney or the tallest peak in your area. You start small, and maybe you're inspired to keep going.</p><blockquote>Activate is about the sense of discovery people get when exploring a new place. It's also about being intrigued by a place and wanting to see more of it.</blockquote><p>When people find things that are educational or inspirational in the space, they are motivated to think more deeply or experience the place differently. Whether it's to learn more about their community, to explore or they’re activated to go somewhere new, which is pretty powerful to give to a community.<br></p><h2><strong>Environmental Graphics in the context of 2021…</strong></h2><p>If you can't go to a restaurant, you can't go to a cinema, you can't go to a sporting event, you can still go outside. Homes are being sold before they're built because the homes are connected to so much… acres and acres of trails and open space. And everyone wants trails and open space and land to get outside now. It allows for ease in social distancing with more space between one family group to another.</p><p>People are stressed out and frenzied, and we need to do things that not only simply inspire joy, but just allow people to breathe and exhale and feel OK wherever they are. I think this whole idea of breathing in the outdoors is important and healthy. But you're asked to wear a mask and it feels counter to what you're wanting to do. So we need to provide visual ways to let people just exhale. I don't know how we're going to do that, but we'll figure it out. Or maybe that's just me holding my breath.</p><p>‍</p><p><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/team/suzanne-redmond-schwartz\"><strong><em>Suzanne Redmond Schwar</em></strong><em>tz</em></a><em> is a founding partner and principal at RSM Design.

An in-depth look at how environmental graphic design can reflect a design process that puts people at the center of the intent, process, and outcome of the experiences that we design.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The neighborhood… the town center… the park… the school… the museum. These are destinations that we return to again and again. They are the soul of our community, the anchors for our memories, and the spaces for inspiration and learning. Creating these unique places requires a vision which combines an appreciation of the human experience, a clear understanding of the built environment, and the relationship between the two.<br></p><p id=\"\">There are no templates in creating places that people truly engage with and appreciate, as every place is uniquely different. Each place offers insights into varied cultures, uses, or perspectives that require their own original recipe for design. It is essential for experiential graphic designers to translate the unique character and qualities of a place with relevance, resonance, and inspiration.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68e723631cd8bf2184a0e1_n02_RSM-Design_Experiential-Design.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Long Beach Exchange, Long Beach, California.

More than simply decorating a space, environmental graphic design is critical to establishing the purpose of a space, the visitor’s place within it, and helping to shape the overall experience. While a visitor may never recognize that design is at play, the work environmental graphic designers do, is essential to establishing that unconscious connection.<br></p><p id=\"\">Environmental graphic design is about creating a vocabulary of design elements that reinforce the architecture and help define the context for a place that people will connect with. Subtleties in design can have a huge impact. A different typeface can completely change the vibe of a place. A well-placed bench can bring moments of comfort and joy. A cool mural or graphic can inspire selfies to share with others. These are the emotional connections that drive people, the unconscious aspects that create resonance and transform a simple visit into a dynamic and memorable experience. This is the art of environmental graphic design at its most powerful.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636c00ed059d9370b7c25a14_Web-Img_Full-2-3_Short.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Long Beach Exchange, Long Beach, California.

The design is clearly more than an aesthetic overlay, going beyond making environmental elements look good, to express the essence of a place. The infusion of design profoundly connects the space to the people that will inhabit and visit the place.<br></p><p id=\"\">Designers of experiential environments have a broad palette to work with—identity, typography, symbols, materials, colors, wayfinding, public art, for example—all the tools needed to root the environment in its place and make it meaningful to each person.

REBRANDING&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>From Miami to Morocco, RSM Design has adapted our branding process as the world refocused its lens in the commercial real estate markets. The pandemic continues to shape shift our relationship with one another and the spaces we share, and because of this, communities, retailers, and developers are responding to a new paradigm. These changes are seen through a shift in community values, meaningful person to person connections, and carefully considered spaces. Ultimately, people are the soul, the vitality, and the purpose for environments in which we thrive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We believe that change is rooted in innovative ideas that work to make peoples’ lives better. RSM Design is committed to changing our communities by <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/services/branding-logo-design\"><strong>designing brands</strong></a> and spaces that reflect stories of the human experience. Our role, now more than ever, is to explore how we are able to creatively communicate these narratives in unique and memorable ways to build the brands of the future.<br></p><p>As we shift further towards a people-centric future, redevelopment has triggered a conversation on how new ideas in programming, leasing, events, and artful moments can create delightful experiences. People are craving shared, authentic moments, and a common branded voice is essential in communicating these messages. Ultimately, a brand must deliver at every level of a project to successfully capture the hearts and loyalty of a market. Delivering an honest and truthful story is critical to the initial buy-in.<br></p><p>Today, we are collaborating with architects, developers, and communities to ask the big question: <em>how will this project be meaningful, competitive, and innovative in our market?&nbsp;</em><br></p><p>At RSM Design, our team is developing brands that are redefining their markets across all sectors, from <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/markets/mixed-use-design\"><strong>mixed-use communities</strong></a> to innovation districts and everything in between. In our brand tool-kit we see the following directives that are driving design conversations with our clients:&nbsp;<br></p><ol><li>Redevelop</li><li>Reposition</li><li>Rebrand<br></li></ol><h2><strong>A new story that needs to be told.</strong></h2><h3><strong>Redevelopment of a neighborhood mixed-use icon</strong><br></h3><p>In the years leading up to the pandemic, RREEF (a unit of the German Deutsche Bank) and managing partner of JLL underwent a $180 million dollar redevelopment project at Manhattan Village. In order to compete with newly built outdoor boutique competitors, the mixed-use hub needed a comprehensive revamp. Seated on 44 acres, the site would be remodeled to create a central green coined “the living room” that would bring the heart of the project outdoors. In addition to a new leasing strategy and renovations to the existing buildings, the project was poised to reposition itself as the casual luxe, social hub with a soul for the region.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61a51cd17315ddc8e6f82db3_RSM-Design_Manhattan-Village_Entrance.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61a51ce8e77faa057683ad43_RSM-Design_Manhattan-Village-Sunset-Courtyard.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>A revised vision and brand was critical in telling the new story of Manhattan Village. RSM Design evolved the existing vision (originally begun by CallisonRTKL), brand, and <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/services/wayfinding-signage\"><strong>signage design</strong></a> (while collaborating with AO) to give the space a voice uniquely its own.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Since the project renovation straddled pre- and post-pandemic, the brand process required innovative ideas that embraced new conversations. In the aftermath of the pandemic, the discovery of simple pleasures, of a life that values community, and our sense of belonging in the world is what inspired our tone for the brand. We stripped it down, lightened the character, and reimagined a palette and voice that reflects a serene and coastal destination. The architectural details as well as marketing and leasing narrative also mirror the brand voice– telling a unified story that resonates with the attitude of surrounding beach cities.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61a51cfab3388b7fbf5dfab0_RSM-Design_Manhattan-Village-Directory-Sign.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61a51d0d92dd35329c6d29b1_RSM-Design_Manhattan-Village-Grass.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>Building an Innovative Brand.</strong></h2><h3><strong>Repositioning of a campus to celebrate science &amp; nature</strong><br></h3><p>What happens when your market no longer aligns with your brand’s promise, mission, or values? That’s when a repositioning is needed.<br></p><p>Repositioning a project focuses on redefining the brand promise, character, values, and intended brand message. It’s not only about how the brand appears from the outside, but also what it communicates from the inside– how it makes us “feel”.<br></p><p>In San Diego, our design team is working alongside Longfellow Real Estate Partners, LLC on the repositioning of <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/biovista-san-diego?s=1\"><strong>Biovista</strong></a>. Longfellow acquired a two-building project in the Sorrento Mesa region– a booming district for science and technology. A former office site lacking modern amenities, the team saw an opportunity to transform the space into a life science campus to reflect where the market is heading.<br></p><p>The process behind the brand positioning included a new name, redefining the mission and values, creating a visual brand mark, and integrating modern amenities and programming.<br></p><p>The repositioning was successful for Biovista because it refocused the project on the market’s current needs. The transformation lent itself to attracting a new and vibrant tenant mix. Ultimately, the new vision positions Biovista as a premier life science campus in the competitive San Diego region.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1400px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1400px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61a51e03eac39bfbbb2ee37f_RSM-Design_Biovista.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>A Brand that Captivates Our Senses.</strong></h2><h3><strong>Rebranding of a Los Angeles social hub</strong><br></h3><p>Rebranding is the concept of changing the visual look of a brand. This strategy includes altering elements of the brand kit of parts, such as a logo. Organizations may choose to rebrand themselves after their graphics become outdated or the brand no longer aligns with a specific message or project goal. A brand mark<strong>,</strong> whether it's a symbol or typographic logo, is the visual display of what a brand stands for. It’s critical that the brand image holds meaning and relevance to the desired market.</p><p>Formerly known as The Promenade at Howard Hughes Center, an acclaimed retail destination at its opening but over time lost popularity due to neighboring retail competitors, recently underwent a rebrand and our design team was invited to rebrand this Los Angeles center. The first step of the brand strategy was to rename the site to <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/hhla\"><strong>HHLA</strong></a>, a shorter and catchier name, then provide a contemporary aesthetic through a brand kit of parts.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f7230436c4dff094e0b7d44_MAIN%20FILE_3.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61a51e30b202bf7be13a479d_RSM-Design_HHLA-Business-cards.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61a51e4c88ac97febebd567c_RSM-Design_HHLA-Stone-sign.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>The successful repositioning captures the spirit of both Howard Hughes’ legendary status, and the modern Los Angeles collective in a fresh new way.

    "post_body": "<p>Earlier this year, RSM Design attended the 2018 Digital Signage Expo in Las Vegas, which partnered with the Society of Experiential Graphic Design (SEGD), to take an in-depth look at branded environments and the new technologies that are evolving how we use signage. The conference was balanced between a day of inspiring workshops and lectures, and a day of exploring the trade show floor, which radiated light from flashing LED’s, touchscreens and thinner than ever video displays. Below are five observations on new trends and exciting technologies that have held up the past few months, and are only beginning to be fully integrated into how we experience and navigate our environments.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d64ce3f90fec7f59365e2_n02-RSM-Design-Five-Observ-2018-DSE_techn-01.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>In 2017, Simon Property Group started incorporating Quividi’s solution into their extensive, innovative digital communication solutions. Quividi’s Audience and Attention measurement platform is deployed on over 500 of the company’s newest digital out-of-home screens around the United States. Quividi’s data and analytics platform provides a useful path to monetize their DOOH network and can also raise the engagement of millions of shoppers visiting Simon’s malls every day.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>1. WE ARE BEING WATCHED</h2><p>Real-time data analytics were on display at the Quividi booth that are able to quickly identify viewer’s age, gender and even their mood. By combing that data with how long each person is viewing, where they are looking while they are viewing and a number of other qualities they are able to provide detailed information about the audience. Examples show digital advertising kiosks that instantly re-edit videos to respond to the age or mood of a viewer, creating a far more engaging and tailored experience.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d64ee7c154e30e9852dbb_n03-RSM-Design-Five-Observ-2018-DSE_techn-02.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Electronic paper museum labels offer custom language settings, providing rich information in multiple languages. In Estonia’s National Museum, each display application interacts with radio frequency identification (RFID) tickets provided to visitors, who then glean useful information in their chosen language – Estonian, English or Russian – when they are near a display.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2. DIGITAL PAPER PACKS A PUNCH</h2><p>E-Ink has evolved form the low resolution and contrast of the initial Amazon Kindles and now is being used as highly dynamic and flexible signage. As a result of the technology’s minimal power requirements signs can operate wirelessly in atypical locations. Elegant and minimal examples were on display that functioned as dynamic door signs or menu boards. A wonderful use of the technology was implemented at the Estonia National Museum were sign messaging is able to quickly change languages to accommodate an international audience.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d650dabe8d98f0d9bc000_n04-RSM-Design-Five-Observ-2018-DSE_techn-03.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Augmented Reality is now a Reality…AR brings a new human interface to react to imagery in the user’s environment, especially in an environment the user is not familiar with; It can be difficult for users to locate an object that’s not positioned onscreen, and a mobile AR app could help users navigate to those objects easier, and with a clearer direction to start.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>3. MAPPING FROM YOUR PHONE</h2><p>Many software engineers are looking at ways to improve wayfinding by blending the use of typical directories with access to smart phones and opportunities in augmented reality. A major player in this arena is ride sharing heavyweight, Uber. In a session with SEGD, Uber Senior Designer Danielle Lindsay-Chung shared a variety of innovations they are developing to enhance the experience, improve safety and avoid miscommunication between riders and drivers. Other companies, like 22 Miles, were displaying wayfinding software applications that could automatically render pathways and preferred routes between multiple floors or buildings.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d668621d609fd1537fa1d_n05-RSM-Design-Five-Observ-2018-DSE_techn-04.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Hypervsn™ is a cutting-edge visual solution for creating, managing and displaying your unique 3D video content with holographic effect. It uniquely combines a smart Hypervsn™ management platform and a Hypervsn™ projection unit, a hi-tech hardware device generating stunning 3D visuals perceived by viewers as hi-resolution holograms floating in the mid-air.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4. FLOATING HOLOGRAMS</h2><p>One of this year’s notable attention grabbing displays was the Hypervsn module by Kino-mo. A spinning LED propeller that creates a floating holographic like image and can be tiled to create large and flexible wall applications. The video effect was surprisingly bright and sharp for a variety of highly rendered animations.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d66c3aa7dc3185f82f1f4_n06-RSM-Design-Five-Observ-2018-DSE_techn-05.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>“Voûtes Célestes” is a generative and interactive virtual-reality artwork by Miguel Chevalier projected onto the Saint Eustache Church’s chancel vaults, its central nave, its transept crossing, and its two transepts. Surprising imaginary sky charts are created in real time. The visitor discovers a variety of colored networks of light that spread out in the form of sinuous webs. These large meshes take form and then lose their shape, changing following the movements of visitors in the central nave, creating ever renewed, diversified universes.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>5. PROJECTING SCREENS ANYWHERE</h2><p>Projection technology has increased considerably, creating brighter, sharper graphics at lower cost than ever. Companies like NEC were showcasing high power laser projection uses that can transform an entire space with motion and graphics that envelop the walls, ceiling and floor. Projection can turn otherwise static architectural elements into moments of surprise or an opportunity for signage without the need for mounting or fabricating a sign panel. With well concealed interior placement, video can be projected onto an exterior glass surface to create high impact visuals that are translucent and maintain visibility into a store or lobby.</p><p> </p><p>The integration of these digital technologies will continue to revolutionize how we find our way, making it easier and more flexible. Navigation will continue to evolve based on the blurring of virtual and real world experiences and advertising will be more targeted than ever based on what information of ours is being constantly shared. As designers shaping how these opportunities will get realized, RSM believes it important to test and prototype often and through a variety of guest touch points. A multi-faceted approach that engages guests and enhances each visit will take careful consideration and curating. With the help of the right design team, a well-executed program will be seamlessly easy to use, creating a sense of wonder and delight as well as providing a truly responsive system that adjusts and adapts to every guest’s needs and desires.</p><p>‍</p><h3>CORY CLINTON, SENIOR ASSOCIATE</h3><p></p><p>Cory Clinton is a signage and wayfinding specialist looking to the future of the industry.

    "post_body": "<p>As Environmental Graphic Designers, we are very aware of the influence the built environment plays on the types of experiences that you have. Some environments generate active excitement, such as a stadium or sports arenas, while others instill reflection and quiet interaction, such as a library or museum gallery. We know that the designed environment plays a significant role in the quality of the experience we have and the memories we take with us. At RSM Design, we strive to uncover creative solutions that foster meaningful connections between people and place. We realize that in every project there is an opportunity to create extraordinary experiences that move away from a traditional Transactional Environment and toward an innovative Transformational Destination.</p><p><strong>Transactional Environments</strong> help us get what we need as efficiently as possible. These environments, such as shopping on Amazon or at a power center/strip mall, are designed to facilitate quick searches, purchases, and exits. They maximize the transactional efficiency of meeting pressing needs, allowing us to get something for the best price with minimal exertion.</p><p>The significant impact we can make as environmental graphic designers is to create <strong>Transformational Experiences</strong>. This approach fosters meaningful experiences at destinations that value the quality and breadth of experiences beyond the exchange of goods and services. The ultimate aim of these places is to encourage visitors to stay longer, enjoy the journey and feel connected and ultimately transformed after they have visited. Visitors gain a sense of place and community and identify with the environment as their own. They then want to share memories with others and encourage them to visit as well.</p><p>We have all been able to sense the difference between Transactional Environments and Transformational Destinations. The first environment may feel streamlined and even sterile, while the second feels thoughtful, engaging, and enriched. The Transactional Environment values speed and efficiency of the momentary need, and the Transitional Destination values quality relationships that evolve but retains relevance. We all have favorite Transformational Destinations that make us feel engaged, alive and inspire our unique stories.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d756699fb88d326759476_n02_RSM-Design_From-Transactional-Environments.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>One of the key questions that RSM Design asks ourselves as a studio is, How can we encourage our visitors to not only enjoy the environments we design but <em>IDENTIFY </em>with them as their own? How do we create Transformational Destinations? Like a diamond in the rough, we believe the intrinsic quality of a place can be uncovered through a deliberate and thoughtful design process. Our job is to uncover the essence of a place and help bring to life deeper meaning, purpose and values that people can connect with.</p><p>RSM Design knows that if we want people to keep coming back to a place, their experience must be meaningful and memorable. We also know that creating an emotional experience is only the first step. The studio finds ways to engage the whole person through all four intelligences by bridging human needs with the built environment, engaging individuals in fundamental ways: Connect, Activate, Think, and Inspire. These concepts tap into the core dimensions of the human experience, engaging the whole person with the built environment.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d75785b7d2f90d6b34ca7_n03_RSM-Design_From-Transactional-Environments.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h3>CONNECT</h3><p>Places that CONNECT foster community, are rooted in the culture and context of the places in which they reside, and provide a strong sense of belonging. Environmental graphics provide a clear identity to a place, capturing the essence and establishes a vocabulary that people can reference as a message or story about the place. The elements of name, logo or mark, color, pattern, materials, geometry, etc. are the placemaking components that work together to align the core values of the project in the physical environment. These elements provide the emotional connection of people to place through multilayered experiences.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d7583792fb41f4f272131_n04_RSM-Design_From-Transactional-Environments.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/pavilion-park-irvine-ca/\"><em>GREAT PARKS NEIGHBORHOODS, IRVINE, CALIFORNIA</em></a><em> Environmental graphics and wayfinding components give Great Park Neighborhoods a strong sense of ownership and emotional connection to its community. The elements personalize the environment with a consistent palette along with a visual language that supports the local story.</em></figcaption></figure><h3>ACTIVATE</h3><p>Places that ACTIVATE engage people in the physical environment. Healthy environments that provide walkability and circulation encourage exploration and engagement. Kevin Lynch’s landmark book, <em>The</em> <em>Image of the City</em>, describes the intuitive elements that help individuals easily understand and navigate a place. By utilizing paths, edges, districts, nodes and landmarks, we can intelligently guide people through an environment. Identity signage and wayfinding elements such as directional signs and directories provide comfort and confidence for people to fully engage with the environment.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d76111564dc600997c21b_n05_RSM-Design_From-Transactional-Environments.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/summit-bechtel-reserve-2/\"><em>THE SUMMIT BECHTEL RESERVE, BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA, MOUNT HOPE, WEST VIRGINIA</em></a><em> Placemaking and wayfinding elements maximize the unique physical connection of people to place that embodies the values of the Boy Scouts at The Summit Bechtel Reserve, a 10,000-acre facility in West Virginia. The Summit Bechtel Reserve site now hosts the National Jamboree attended by approximately 70,000 scouts, volunteers and staff with wide-ranging activities from mountain biking, zip lining to skateboarding.</em></figcaption></figure><h3>THINK</h3><p>Places that make you THINK engage the mind. These places encourage people to explore, question, learn and experience something new. Storytelling becomes a vital component in fostering learning, such as educational programs in public spaces. Interactive educational elements for landmarks and placemaking components provide thoughtful and relevant engagement with places that enrich the understanding of places and their history or current cultural context.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d763116c527d49d37988c_n06_RSM-Design_From-Transactional-Environments.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/university-of-california-riverside/\"><em>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA</em></a><em> Unifying environmental elements provide the UCR campus with common areas that foster thoughtful interaction and community connection.

Through a series of carefully orchestrated experiences, people awaken their senses, pause and enjoy the environment on a new level. These places ask people to be present and aware, as well as adding a layer of purpose and meaning that enriches the experience. Places that inspire have integrity in their design as they align vision and values with authentic environments.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d76464bf11c037920eb7d_n07_RSM-Design_From-Transactional-Environments.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/portfolio/pacific-city-case-study/\"><em>PACIFIC CITY, HUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIFORNIA</em></a><em> Pacific City was the maiden name of the California village that eventually became Huntington Beach.

The Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance is one of many shopping malls around the world attracting large numbers of international shoppers, in part due to the proximity to a major international airport, a trend getting the attention of developers and retailers. Del Amo hosts 200 international travelers a night, among them, French, German, and Dutch flight crews staying at the adjacent Torrance Marriott, according to a recent article in the Daily Breeze.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5296c918a09b3277d93286_n05-RSM-Design-Del-Amo_architecture.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">The repositioning of the Del Amo Fashion Center took into consideration the impact of the international shopper arriving from Los Angeles International Airport while creating a new experience and look for the once-fading shopping center. The Del Amo mall had fallen victim to its own physical nostalgia, following the fate of many architectural icons from the 60’s and 70’s. Brick pavers and dated details left little to be desired by local shoppers looking for more a modern experience.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5297c1d2aeb9f74a8c0ddd_n07-RSM-Design-Del-Amo_parkingprojectid.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">RSM Design worked with Simon Properties Group, &nbsp;to complement and define a new brand that merged an urban beach aesthetic with international elements into a single fluid and sophisticated tone.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5297db25caddd0eb5ca23f_n03-RSM-Design-Del-Amo_directory.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Capitalizing on the coastal location, design inspiration was taken from elements of the waters’ fluid lines and bright sunlight, which were all woven into the new Del Amo brand. The RSM Design team was inspired by the ocean, natural woods and grand sweeping lines emblematic of waves and sails. All these themes were incorporated throughout the signage and wayfinding program.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5297f8bc994929e143e662_n02-RSM-Design-Del-Amo_pylon.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">These elements were used by the RSM Design team to provide subtle details that complement the modern edge of Del Amo’s new brand within the logo, monumentation signage and wayfinding design. RSM Design used patterning and pops of color throughout the project to support the coastal chic elegance of this new, refreshed environment.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f52980dd2aeb967438c45f7_n06-RSM-Design-Del-Amo_pylon-02.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">The contemporary look is an impressive upgrade from the Del Amo of the past decade. Seeing the before-and-after images reinforces how much has changed since the mall’s origination. Part of the challenge in this exercise was unifying three separate mall pads into one new center, while creating an easy shopping experience for guests on foot, starting with their arrival in parking lots and garages.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f52991faa6724f54f8f5ad2_n08-RSM-Design-Del-Amo_bldgmounted.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Bright open and airy entryways filled with sunlight, which highlight the fluid contours of the interior architecture, are a stark contrast to the dimly-lit brick walls that once limited the interest of today’s shopper. Lighting experts KGM were selected by Simon to bring experience and success used on previous international jobs. KGM captured the sophistication of European shopping experiences, enhancing the interior re-design and elegant lines of the new space.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5299c8d7d56ab39577908f_n09-RSM-Design-Del-Amo_peddir.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">This new standard sets a mark for Simon, a refreshing offering within the retailers’ portfolio to both domestic and international guests, who have already begun to visit this center in droves. According to Simon Property Group officials, Del Amo is now the largest shopping center in the western United States and the fifth largest in the nation.</p>"

LeBauer Park was the vision of Carolyn LeBauer, who passed away in 2012, but left a fund to the Community Foundation of Greensboro with the instructions to \"build a spectacular park.\" And now, after a few years of planning and design by The Office of James Burnett, LeBauer Park is a spectacular reality. The park amenities include everything from a putting green to a children's rock wall, a playground, performance space, and an opportunity for public art installations (which right now features a <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/793438/janet-echelmans-railroad-inspired-net-sculpture-premiers-in-north-carolina?utm_medium=email&utm_source=ArchDaily%20List\" id=\"\">beautiful installation</a> from Janet Echelman).

The goal of the project was to develop a simple, elegant, and organic approach to the signage, to help create a place where visitors could discover the many amenities. Additionally, given its prime location surrounded by the Children's Museum, ArtQuest, and the library, the signage had to be friendly and welcoming to visitors of all ages.</p><p id=\"\">‍<br></p>"

This year’s award goes to someone who has been an incredible leader and innovator for the Chapter: Harry A. Mark, FAIA</em></p><p><em> For the past two years, Harry has fearlessly led our Columns teams. We joke that Harry didn’t know what he was signing up for when he agreed to serve as editor of Columns, but he has tackled every challenge thrown his way – from editorial and graphic direction, to strategic advertising decisions, to the human resources side of running a publication. His vision for Columns to reach beyond the profession to engage potential clients has led to annual themes that challenge us – Equity, Ego, Morality, and Fashion were this year’s topics. His impeccable graphic eye has taken the publication to new heights, advocating for a redesign and for more engaging illustrations and photography. AND – he does all of this while juggling between his two office locations in Dallas and San Clemente.”</em></p><p><em>–President, Nunzio DeSantis, FAIA</em></p><p>We’d like to congratulate you, Harry, on all your hard work and your service to the American Institute of Architects. We’re grateful for your leadership in the architecture and design community, as well as here at RSM Design! </p><p><em>Columns</em> is a magazine that focuses on architecture and culture in Dallas, published by the AIA Dallas chapter.

Whether for a hospital campus, wellness center, or education campus, RSM Design begins with the end in mind, developing a meticulous and thorough research, strategy and design platform. Our team creates architectural graphic design solutions that are both functional and innovative, providing a sense of ease and comfort to visitors and patients, focusing on improving the current state of health and wellness environments.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68e19df7918d72959bd51a_n02_RSM-Design_Heathcare.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Image credits: Dugoni School of Dentistry and Jon Draper</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68e1a33901ed554f0a9557_n03_RSM-Design_Heathcare.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>Designing an Individual Health Journey</strong></h3><p>A strategy rooted in a ‘people-first’, holistic needs journey allows us to diagnose before we prescribe a solution that creates a future state understanding before we put pen to paper. Through the use of interviews, outreach and workshops our team is able to facilitate a design process that identifies the potential health journeys and all the points of brand or wayfinding needs along those paths. These touchpoints allow us to step into the shoes of the patient, family or staff to build an intuitive path to follow, ensuring that the guidance is more than a point A to B experience. Our goal is to utlize the following principles to create a cognitive map of one’s journey:</p><p><br></p><p>• Transform the patient experience into a guest experience (Hospitality Quotient - HQ)</p><p>• Friendly, inviting, comfortable (tap into other human needs)</p><p>• Engaging each journey as a personal approach to design and sensitivity</p><p>• Fundamental aspects of human needs</p><p>• Heightened sensitive, stress or unsuredness level</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68e09b301d0b6f2af93105_n04_RSM-Design_Heathcare.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>Reflecting Brand Values and Voice</strong></h3><p>Each healthcare provider, educational campus or private facility has a brand identity that must be woven into the patient (guest) journey. These brand defining touch points along paths of decision-making must reflect the values and voice of that brand to the patient, family or staff. The logo, core values and brand promise are both tangible and intangible elements that immediately create a perception of care, thoughtfulness and comfort within an environment. Our creative team creates wayfinding and master signage systems that carry the institution’s brand identity throughout the healthcare campus and makes a potentially stressful visit to a relaxing and empowering experience. Through creative placemaking and environmental graphic design, RSM Design transforms even the most confusing or complicated healthcare spaces into engaging guest experiences. We have developed a methodology for these touchpoints we like to call: CERTAINTY, VARIETY AND DELIGHT</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CERTAINTY</strong></p><p>Within every environment one must have a level of certainty to confirm that one has arrived to one’s destination or that you are indeed on the right path. As we all know, if life has too much certainty, even in a healthcare setting, the feeling of a sterile and systemic care environment is pervasive, hence the need for a bit of uncertaintly or variety.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatleft\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68e0bd1532cc6f1ab5f976_n05_RSM-Design_Heathcare.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Consistency to provide a sense of certainty that you are on the right path.

Within a patient journey there are many points where you must identify, inform, direct or remind someone of where they are in their journey. We call this cognitive mapping where we must help create a mental map to allow an understanding of where I am, where I am going and how do I get back. Layering variety within this allows us to create memorable moments whether that is a colored wall or an amazing curated artful element so that place becomes a mental landmark. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68e0dc1532cc3aa7b617e6_n07_RSM-Design_Heathcare.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Color and landmarks to help provide variety for the journey.

We understand that the majority of healthcare experiences come with an element of anxiety, stress and fear. Our goal is to align our strategy and design to occur in parallel with those feelings to counteract and encourage the need for comfort to be fulfilled. We all crave delight even in the most difficult of times in our life. Delight can be an ingredient to aid in overcoming these trials by creating quiet, energy, surprise or even humor along one’s path.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatleft\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68e1163901ed68770a46ad_n09_RSM-Design_Heathcare.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Detail of graphic letters include a fun discovery.

Central to this approach is building a framework of user experience points throughout the journey from pre-arrival brand introduction to on-site lasting brand impressions. Examination through this lens allows insight into the experience of patients, visitors and staff and their unique physical, spatial, emotional and mental needs at each juncture, and that can be positively enhanced by a supportive built environment.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=\"\">By making the patient and visitor experience more intuitive and less stressful, a comprehensive and strategic wayfinding strategy can alleviate the anxiety that comes with uncertainty.<br></p><p id=\"\">At RSM Design, our people-centered approach to wayfinding begins by identifying unique experience points within the patient and visitor journey where people engage directly with the healthcare brand by moving through or interacting with the built environment.

It must also include interactive digital tools such as a wayfinding app and web presence that provide step by step instructions from driving to the final appointment destination. Comprehensive wayfinding also entails working with local municipalities to approve branded experience points on roadways and off-site locations.</p><p id=\"\">These and other wayfinding strategies reinforce the healthcare provider’s brand identity and help realize their goals as they may improve the experience of patients and visitors.</p><p id=\"\">The ideal pre-visit experience is developed alongside the on-site strategy.

From the moment patients and visitors enter the property, it should be clear what they need to do next. An effective wayfinding strategy provides a sense of certainty to patients and visitors by considering every aspect of that experience, including site design and architecture, landscape elements, vehicular traffic flow, parking, building identification, lobby orientation, interior navigation, and, notably, cultural context.</p><p id=\"\">At every step, it is essential to empower patients and visitors with choices in how they receive the wayfinding information — even a subtle or unconscious choice can help create a more positive experience. Good on-site wayfinding doesn’t assume a particular “type” of patient. Rather, it accommodates people of all ages, abilities, and demographics by communicating information in multiple ways at once through color coding, alpha-numeric systems and graphic symbols, as well as opportunities for human interaction.

We consider everything from circulation, operations, approach, site lines, traffic studies, environmental impact and pedestrian flows. We hold workshops with the community of users and stakeholders to understand their perspectives and needs before arriving at solutions. We have designed a methodology for testing through prototypes and survey users about their experience. We learn what works, what doesn’t, and how best to incorporate those lessons into our final strategy.</p><p id=\"\">We have seen the difference that comprehensive and strategic wayfinding can make firsthand — in both smaller healthcare facilities, such the University of the Pacific School of Dentistry and larger healthcare campuses like the Texas Medical Center.

Most of these principles are incorporated into <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/what-is-wayfinding-part-3-wayfinding-is-more-than-just-signage/\">wayfinding design systems</a>, to bridge the gap across languages and cultures, and to create a strong visual connection to aid in location and directions.</p><p>So what is missing? What makes the way a child navigates so different that exploring how they interact with the environment will teach us new ways to enhance and elevate our wayfinding systems and environmental experiences?</p><p>While presenting a design on a new system for airport wayfinding, <a href=\"https://segd.org/herbert-seevinck\">Herbert Seevinck</a> discussed the idea of creating a “kid-friendly airport.” We’ve all seen stressed families during our travels, managing anything from wailing babies to rogue children running the wrong way on a people mover, knocking into innocent travelers and causing minor havoc.</p><h3><strong>TO DETER BEHAVIOR LIKE THIS, WHAT IF WE INCORPORATED MORE PLAY ELEMENTS INTO AIRPORTS FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS?</strong></h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f469491ffb365c21792a6cf_n03-RSM-Design-Human-Centered-Child-Use-This_path.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><em>The Flight Path installation at </em><a href=\"https://www.atl-airport.com/\"><em>Atlanta Airport</em></a><em> is one of many examples of how designers are working to soften stressful travel experiences and engage both children and adults alike.</em></figcaption></figure><p>There have been many explorations of airport corridors with art installations.

By subtly engaging travelers with the environment around them, these small moments help lower the stress of travelers and provide an opportunity to explore and learn.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f469706a7c6e22053371bbe_n04-RSM-Design-Human-Centered-Child-Use-This_fountain.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><em>Engaging all of the senses, especially touch and hearing, can be beneficial not only in a child's development but also in creating accessible and inclusive wayfinding systems.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Children love to touch and by using texture we can influence emotions to help guide behavior. Sharp, rough, and pointy textures seem unsafe or unwelcoming. Soft, fuzzy, or shaggy textures appear warm, comfortable and invite engagement. John deWolf from Form:Media discussed a wayfinding system in use at <a href=\"https://www.rgd.ca/2019/03/04/south-shores-regional-library-case-study.php\">Lunenburg Library</a> that utilized felt as a central material. Signs made with textured materials are calling to be touched and enjoyed and ultimately, remembered. Tactile signage provides children a more effective way to identify, recall, and communicate their location with ease. “I’m by the fuzzy blue sign,” is much easier for a child to understand and communicate than “Floor 2 Room 128.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.mijksenaar.com/project/amsterdam-airport-schiphol-p1-parking/\">Mijksenaar Amsterdam Airport</a> also presented ideas to help visitors remember their location by adding sound to the standard use of icons, color, and language. They demonstrated this with a video of a family exiting a parking garage when suddenly, a loud “MOO!” is emitted from the overhead speakers. To enhance memory recall they had not only assigned each level in the parking garage a color and an animal but added the audio cue of the animal’s call in the elevator lobbies of the level. Imagine asking a child where the family parked their car – they may remember the color of the floor or even the animal assigned to the level, but they would almost certainly remember “MOO!”</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4697cd745de8576789f050_n05-RSM-Design-Human-Centered-Child-Use-This_cow-wayfinding.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><em>Mijksenaar designed a wayfinding system that included sound as part of the navigation.

Ching. Originally published in 1974 and now in its sixth edition, it continues to introduce and influence the fundamentals of graphic and design communication. The architectural graphic conventions outlined in the book informed my design process and served as a guide to see a design conveyed and built. Along with the go-to reference book on building design and construction known as the “architect’s bible” or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Architectural-Graphic-Standards-Ramsey-Sleeper/dp/111890950X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1539054228&sr=1-1&keywords=Architectural+Graphic+Standards\"><em>Architectural Graphic Standards</em> (American Institute of Architects, 12th edition)</a> I was all set to branch out into the design profession.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d419d7404af85bed1a0e5_n02_RSM-Design_Its-Time-To-Redefine.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Do these books define the term “Architectural Graphic Design”?</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fast forward a few decades later and I find myself working and creating at an exciting crossroads… the intersection of architecture and graphic design. My attitude and definition of the term <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/architectural-graphic-design/\">architectural graphic design</a> has changed quite a bit since Francis D.K. Ching, and I have found myself redefining what the relationship of architecture and graphics is all about and practicing a different form of architectural graphic design… one that engages the third dimension.</p><p>Our studio, RSM Design, was founded in 1997 using the term “<a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/environmental-graphic-design/\">environmental graphic design</a>” because we loved seeing how graphic design could shape and influence the physical environment in the built realm, and most importantly how graphics influenced the people using the spaces and making the places. The term “environmental graphic design” has always been an obtuse term and one that is still being defined and ill-defined by many. Over time the use of “environmental” has been referenced more for its ecological and natural uses, rather than the physical setting or surrounding, making it even more difficult to associate environmental with graphics. “No, we do not do ‘green’ sustainable graphics,” I have found myself saying when describing what it is that our studio creates.</p><p>While I do not know the reasoning why, I did find it curious when a few years ago the professional organization of the Society of Environmental Graphic Design dropped “environmental” to now become the <a href=\"https://segd.org/\">Society for Experiential Graphic Design</a>. Is this new term any less obtuse than the original? I contend that what our studio is practicing and investigating is how integrated graphic design can symbiotically relate to architecture, hence redefining the term “architectural graphic design.”</p><p>With the recent passing of the influential Robert Venturi, I have again reconsidered the relationship of graphic design and architecture and wanted to understand and redefine how to interpret architectural graphic design. &nbsp;In the book he co-authored with Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour forty-six years ago, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Las-Vegas-Forgotten-Architectural/dp/026272006X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1539054562&sr=1-1&keywords=Learning+from+Las+Vegas\"><em>Learning from Las Vegas</em></a>, the “decorated shed” relies on imagery, signage, and graphics to convey its program, in contrast with the “duck” that expresses the program and meaning thru the building’s form. The architectural graphic designs clearly become an integral part of the building’s commercial character and there becomes a new focus on the architecture of the everyday. Today, the commercial character and culture is more powerful and pervasive than ever.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4209f9c935d8dafb00e5_n03_RSM-Design_Its-Time-To-Redefine.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Learning from Las Vegas (1972, Venturi, Scott Brown, Izenour)</em></figcaption></figure><p>As relevant as commercial architectural graphic design is to buildings and places today, it did not begin with the conversation initiated by Venturi. The disciplines of architecture and graphic design have lived harmoniously and symbiotically together for a long time. Architectural graphic design is not new. It has been around for centuries but only relatively recently have been recognized as an important component of the project narrative. Whether through hieroglyphics, classical inscriptions, façade stenciling (<a href=\"https://www.vienna-unwrapped.com/otto-wagner-vienna/\">Otto Wagner in Vienna</a>), strong building identities (<a href=\"https://billypenn.com/2016/05/19/the-story-behind-phillys-iconic-psfs-building-our-og-skyscraper/\">PSFS Building in Philadelphia</a>), and many other relevant examples, the two disciplines work together to create a cohesive narrative (or “story”) of the building and the way the visitor interacts with it. This marriage is not confined to buildings alone, but also manifests itself in civic spaces and urban places where <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/city-signage-design/\">signage</a>, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/wayfinding-design/\">wayfinding</a>, and art combine to create richness, character, functionality, and engagement.</p><p>Architecture speaks of space, form, place, and function while integrated architectural graphic design communicates a building’s function, purpose, message, and narrative. Effective and appropriate architectural graphic designs support the statement made by a building and strengthen its presence. The graphics layered into the conversation derive from the architectural context, spatial context, cultural context, and historical context to which they relate. They are not independent nor superficial. The architectural graphic designs have meaning, form, function, and purpose… similar to the architecture. Whether these architectural graphic designs are woven into the building or space through <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/branding-logo-design/\">identity signage</a>, wayfinding signage, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/placemaking-public-art/\">specialty features</a>, or graphic embellishments, there is an open dialogue that mutually benefits one another. The inclusion of the architectural graphic designs creates a strong sense of place, fulfills human needs, helps users find their way, and communicates a building’s narrative, fostering a strong conversation between the person and place.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d423fe125ae46388b5273_n04_RSM-Design_Its-Time-To-Redefine.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>As environments, buildings, and spaces are crafted there are many unique disciplines that play a role in their overall success. The profession’s design process has to be multidisciplinary and collaborative, now more than ever. Important elements such as lighting, mechanical, structural, and landscape need to be joined by architectural graphic design as an equally important layer. The <a href=\"https://www.aia.org/\">American Institute of Architects</a> has twenty-one <a href=\"https://www.aia.org/pages/4856-aia-knowledge-communities\">Knowledge Communities</a> that work to share information and create connections that advance the profession. It’s time to make architectural graphic design the twenty-second conversation within this community.</p><p>So, let’s rethink the relationship of architecture and graphic design and what the term “architectural graphic design” refers to. Move away from the two-dimensional references of architectural representation and weave graphics more deliberately into the vocabulary of the building profession as a necessary component. The relationship of architecture and graphic design should now become a symbiotic and necessary alliance that will orient, inform, and delight. Architectural graphic design can make a difference.</p>"

I began by thinking about what makes my journey unique or meaningful. I soon realized that as Angelenos, our day is made up of mini-journeys; a series of trips as we navigate the city on our daily, sometimes arduous commutes. We are part of a county of 10 million people and we find ourselves sitting in our cars or the Metro, biking or walking the city streets from home to work each day. Our relationship with the environment influences the way we attribute meaning and understanding with our city.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d5f4d704acb63b693e498_n02_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>In the seminal book, <em>The Image of the City</em>, Kevin Lynch explores the urban notion that “nothing is experienced by itself, but always in relation to its surroundings, the sequences of events leading up to it, the memory of past experiences”. The context simultaneously reflects and creates meaning and memories. In essence, the city shapes our point of view, bringing us into a particular relationship with other people and activities.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d5f55abe8d9f2f397e61c_n03_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>When I moved from Texas to Los Angeles in 1996, I quickly realized that Los Angeles was huge; a series of mini-cities that covered almost 5,000 square miles. I knew I needed a way to decipher this new city and I needed a tool that would help me navigate this massive connection of highways, roads and neighborhoods. Along with fellow pre-GPS Angelinos, I bought my first Thomas guide. I quickly highlighted, Post-it noted and dog-eared my relevant maps to make that driving down the 405 and simultaneously flipping spiraled pages effortless. In reflecting back on those days of driving while balancing the Thomas Guide on my lap, I realized that our journeys were deliberate, self-created, and relatively predictable. As a result, our daily experiences were finite and the mental image of the landscape was fairly constant.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d5f794a22900a430eec4d_n04_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>Flash forward to 2018 and the tools have changed that paradigm. Angelinos are obsessed with checking traffic reports to fervently assess the road conditions, as much as having a morning latte. Waze has become our standard, crowd-sourced navigation tool to help us shave a few minutes off the morning and evening commutes. This tool has each of us bisecting, short-cutting and alley-hopping our way through the streets of LA. Waze (and other navigational map apps) save us precious time, seducing us to follow the line into off-the-beaten path into unchartered streets, alleys and neighborhoods, just to save a few minutes. We face a road network that is often disconnected, under construction, or unsafe, all of which digital traffic apps cannot prepare us for.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d5fa2bdb1e1c8205dd4f1_n05_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>This city is an urban grid, but Los Angeles has four basic ecologies that form our network of roads and highways. Reyner Banham, architectural writer of <em>Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies</em>, wrote in the 1960’s, “The distances and the reliance on mechanical transportation leave no room for accident – even for happy accidents. You plan the day in advance, program your activities, and forgo those random encounters with friends and strangers that are traditionally one of the rewards of city life.” As we consider the current state of Los Angeles, we see that this observation by Banham is a valuable insight.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d5fe62c574513bb7367d1_n06_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>Navigational tools have changed as the city has evolved, and as our jobs and relationships have been altered, we see ourselves using streets differently. Our experience has become a series of unpredictable journeys, moments and experiences that are shaped by waypoints, mile by mile. The urban fabric of Los Angeles continues to be shaped by development. We see evidence of this through examples of <em>“Ghost Streets” </em>(Geoff Manaugh, 2015) that document the lost streets and spaces of the city’s past. These streets and places were once vibrant roadways that connected viable residential and commercial destinations. As development areas took shape and commercial priorities evolved, road networks were altered for traffic efficiency or political/economic boundary shifts. The effect of these manipulations in the fabric of the city include unique architectural or public spaces that become deviations from the rhythm of networks. As we layer the unpredictability of our daily journeys due to the unpredictability of road improvements, congestion or accidents we see a change in how we each experience the city. We begin to see connections, meaning and influences in places we had not known before.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d600875dc5b27b6893e0d_n07_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>At RSM Design, a “Principle-Centered Approach” allows the designers to stand on four fundamental pillars: Connect, Inspire, Think, and Activate. We build our creative culture around the ideal that people are at the core of everything we do. We believe that the work has to engage people at every human level – the body, the mind, the heart, and the spirit. The pillar of <strong>CONNECT </strong>is intrinsic to our business practice, allowing us to purposefully set out to shape and curate moments within the spaces we design. As designers that live and work in Los Angeles and Southern California, we believe that we must build on the past, examining the roots of a community or a culture to find deeper relevance. Hyper-localism is an important research tool that builds a strong storytelling layer and helps us create a unique sense of place.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d601e6e16100e7416db4e_n08_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>INSPIRATION</strong> comes in many forms within the RSM Design culture. We are constantly reflecting the cultures and communities in which we design. We use the stories, legacies and insights about a place to frame design cues. We do not believe in mimicry, but in creating and translating the familiar. These translations leave authentic touch points, moments of integrity and richness for the people who use them. We believe in the moments that are unused, unnoticed or left-over. We find beauty in utilizing surfaces and spaces left untouched that can serve as a catalyst for WOW.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d604394bc3872e217a21f_n09_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>We have found that moments which are designed with meaning in mind become landmarks over time. The work begins to have a life of its own, finding its way into the hearts and minds of its users. The way we <strong>THINK</strong> about the work we create starts by merging our understanding of place, story, and people. We have observed designed elements gaining symbolic importance for people and communities as a “symbology of place,” where meeting places become points of celebration or contemplation.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d60efc6314b39bf419817_n10_RSM-Design_Mapping-the-Spaces-Between.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>One of our core principals is to <strong>ACTIVATE</strong> our projects by connecting people to place. Whether you’re a LA local or an international visitor, the goal remains the same: we want guests to explore, be delighted and experience memorable moments. These impressions, especially in the context of a notoriously car-centric city like Los Angeles, build long-term connections with places that people identify with and crave to return again and again.</p><p>As I reflect on the city in which we design, I am reminded that we are building on a legacy, an evolution of place and culture. We are constantly evaluating and learning from our surroundings, finding inspiration from unlikely sources, and helping to tell untold stories in new ways.<br></p>"

In a city like Miami, the waterfront is the most valued stretch of land; it bounds neighborhoods and defines culture. The team's goal was to transform Miami’s waterfront into a place for everyone through a process that drew insights, directives, and passions directly from the public. Through a series of public outreach and design charrettes, RSM generated criteria for the naming, branding, and design of the overall experience.</p><h3><strong>“MIAMI WATERWALK WILL CREATE AN EXPERIENCE THAT WILL CELEBRATE BISCAYNE BAY AND THE RIVER’S ECOLOGY, HISTORY AND CULTURE BY CONNECTING PEOPLE TO A CONTINUOUS, VIBRANT, RESILIENT AND ICONIC WATERFRONT.”</strong></h3><p>The design for Miami Waterwalk consists of 16 miles of walking and biking paths, tying together over 30 public and private properties. These paths include lighting, landscaping, hardscape, and placemaking elements such as seating, shade, sculptures, and art which will tie together a united public space. Each component was designed for placemaking and programming, ideas that came directly from the public. Their top concerns were RSM's immediate directives.</p><p>‍</p><p>Read More about this project in our previous blog post:</p><p>‍</p>"

When designing the signage and graphics for Rodeo 39 RSM Design creatively approached the wayfinding for the project. The Stanton sign codes strictly regulate size and quantity for identity signage. RSM Design proposed using large wall mural installations as primary wayfinding elements, creating not only visual landmarks, but beautifying the neighborhood at the same time.</p><p>The murals were specifically designed for a specific function at each location. One mural acts as an abstract artistic version of a project ID along the primary road. Another mural incorporates a stylized arrow pattern to be used as a directional.

    "post_body": "<p id=\"\">National Landing in Arlington, Virginia encompasses three major neighborhoods: Crystal City, Pentagon City, and Potomac Yard. The National Landing BID (Business Improvement District), located at the center of the DC region, invited RSM Design to craft a wayfinding and signage strategy and global wayfinding and experience trends to position the neighborhood as a world-class leader in innovation as a people-centric environment. The goal was to create a cohesive, “future-proof” design system that can be adapted by future neighborhood development through the implementation of smart technology in the three major neighborhoods to improve the pedestrian experience throughout.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Strategy</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/63851a4e27211be28f115356_RSM-Design_National-Landing_Maps.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane Reiner-Roth:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In the context of 21st century America, how did you design a “pedestrian minded experience” for National Landing?&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Cory Clinton:</h3><p id=\"\">It was important that the National Landing BID leverage the density of the surrounding area while moving away from what had historically been uninviting, highly trafficked boulevards. We wanted to alleviate that by creating a consistent arrival experience that would help guests explore the three districts within National Landing without relying on the cars. We proposed a multi-layered approach, some of which is timeless in an architectural relationship with the landscape, such as sculptures to create landmarks that people want to visit that help them find their place within National Landing or more explicit physical wayfinding pieces at entry points and nodes. Other solutions are more reliant on current technology, handheld devices with apps designed to guide people using tools like maps, augmented reality and projection mapping compatible with the 5G technology in National Landing.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cody Clark:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">One of the things that we wanted to do was to bring the experience back to the individual so that the neighborhood can celebrate the pedestrian — something we learned by looking at Kevin Lynch’s approach to sensitive urban planning in The Image of the City, but with a 21st century spin. By offering easy movement throughout the neighborhood, this multi mobility network also invites visitors to feel free in investigating the unique details of National Landing. But this led us to ask: how do you facilitate the means by which people can meaningfully decipher the elements of their environment? How do you make them want to celebrate and discover their neighborhood rather than merely get from point A to B? We wanted commuters and tourists alike to become curious by inviting that element of discovery.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/63851ae3b398e47c0c77cfad_RSM-Design_National-Landing_Transit-Directory-Map.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Can you elaborate on the trends studies you conducted to arrive at the final application of placemaking and wayfinding strategies for National Landing?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cody:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">RSM developed a global trends benchmarking process that outlined innovative applications of wayfinding in urban, civic environments. Our process outlined key municipalities and public/private developments that are using commercially viable and experimental static and digital tools to layer into the physical environment. Our goal was to provide a wide range of tools that would support the key objectives. Our findings centered around market experience and how AI or personal devices might aid in transit, placemaking or education concerning the build environment.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">What were your precedents for National Landing?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Downtown Santa Monica may have been one of them, but it was generally difficult to find parallels that dealt with a project of this large a scale. Because we were looking toward the future, the Walk NYC and Legible London projects became valuable case studies that we used quite a bit. We were looking for holistic approaches to a system that’s consistent from the bus stops to the train stops to those on the street directories and digital apps.. Also, older cities like Amsterdam that have a long history of integrating bike navigation informed a lot of our trend research.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2208px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"2208px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6386a67e1197c47e647946d4_NL-Diagram-Trends.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Micromobility &amp; Tech Integration</h2><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">When you brought up the the idea of “celebrating the pedestrian,” I was reminded that in America, the pedestrian has been more or less villainized the word “jaywalking” came into existence in the early 1920s to lay the blame on pedestrians for car accidents rather than the car owners as a means of privileging automobile access to the city. In National Landing, you are undoing a lot of the history of this relationship between pedestrians and car drivers in a uniquely American context.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">They identified the presence of cars in the neighborhood as a real safety concern, as well as something that was limiting pedestrian access across the site. Another big piece of the pedestrian story is micro-mobility, including the bicycle experience and rentable scooters. These modes of transportation enhance the pedestrian experience by offering flexibility and the option to move at your pace, while reducing the need for cars. Planned improvements to bike lanes and sidewalks can be optimized with signage that creates safer environments and access to micro-mobility wayfinding hubs.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6386a6d3cd3d5ead7180288a_RSM-Design_National-Landing_Streetscape-Rendering.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">What technology might be initially unfamiliar to visitors to National Landing when they first arrive?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The idea of a truly dynamic wayfinding system is a new approach to an urban center like this. Based on the fluctuating needs and traffic conditions, we envision a system that can respond to best routes, parking availability and transit schedules. Visitors will no longer have to rely solely on static signage or be uninformed about potential hazards or delays. If the system is designed correctly, the learning curve for new technology should be fast and effortless, with messaging located exactly when and where you need it.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1896px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1896px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6386a6951197c44ed4796fad_NL-Diagram-5G.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Interior vs Exterior Wayfinding</h2><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">How do you feel that designing a wayfinding system for something as large and open-air as National Landing is different from that of vast interiors, such as airports or malls?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">I think it’s a lot of the same principles, because in both, it’s about understanding where people need information and where they’re going. The solutions for offering safety and certainty are often the same because both provide opportunities for placemaking elements, such as sculptures, murals, and other kinds of landmarks that might speak to the community.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cody:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">I would say that the experience of time is different between large interiors and neighborhoods: how people experience spaces and the duration of time. It does change how you design for people. The elements of National Landing, for instance, are things that people will be seeing every day. These will be places that people really love and have associations with already. In a neighborhood, you want wayfinding systems around only where they are needed. They should ultimately be experiencing their neighborhood, their architecture and parks, and their families more often than they interact with signs. And so I think that’s actually much more tangible, because in other contexts, such as an airport, visitors will have a relatively dissociated experience. In other environments, you have to turn up the volume and frequency of wayfinding systems.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Yes, in an airport, a mall or a subway system, there is often a more deliberate movement, and the signage is therefore expected to be crystal clear and omnipresent. How do the wayfinding systems you have designed for National Landing reflect the fact that it is not an interior, but rather a layered community?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The initial arrival and parking experience is more akin to that of going to the airport, but after making the transition from the garage to the street, the wayfinding systems are usually only there where needed to help people make a decision. That choice could be based on curiosity or it could be based on the easiest&nbsp; route to their destination. We look for ways of integrating with the existing downtown infrastructure, for instance, where there is a lot of pedestrian activity, in which we can integrate wayfinding systems into public kiosks or as part of a plaza area where people will be taking a little more time between finding their way to the next place.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cody:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It’s similar to the public parking branded system in Downtown Santa Monica. Anywhere you go downtown, there’s that icon, and that color. Even though they are owned by different parking operators, they are rebranded as one, and their exteriors are more or less pure sign systems. Then once you’re out, how many signs are there in the pedestrian areas? Not many. But you have them where you need them. The outdoor experience shouldn’t be like a mall, but it should be clear nonetheless.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1471px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1471px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6386a6a67f38c9c5e21a922b_NL-Diagram-Ped.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">Physical &amp; Digital Connection</h2><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">What do you hope other cities might see in National Landing as an example of how the infrastructure of a city can provide ‘feedback’ to its users through smart technology?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">One of the fundamental priorities of this project was to be responsive to accessibility concerns in every dimension imaginable. They wanted a system that would work for everyone: spanning those that are hearing and/or sight impaired, but also those that come to the neighborhood speaking different languages or users from varying socio-economic conditions. That goes back to the concept of ‘layered systems,’ where the full breadth of the system might include experiences that you have on your phone, but also digital hubs that can access the internet for those without phones, as well as Braille options, haptic feedback, and other technologies that could inform people outside of just a single app or even a single language. We considered a wide range of devices, which could include artificial intelligence software and digital kiosks that might predict what visitors are looking for and help them along like a neighborhood concierge that is both highly recognizable and approachable.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">How might smart technology be used to increase the safety of an urban center?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">One of the key needs identified was improving the wayfinding visual consistency and unifying the site. An exciting way that technology can help with this unification is through a digital “hand-off” between signage in the physical environment to your mobile device. This could create checkpoints for guests to confirm their route along the way, as well as integrate up-to-date information on changes or conditions, all in a consistent graphic language.<br></p><p id=\"\">We&nbsp; researched a number of new apps and technologies that are improving safety. Important touchpoints in an environment like National Landing are crosswalks, bike lanes and accessibility for all visitors. For example, there are some amazing apps designed for the visually impaired that use 3D audio technology to describe your surroundings and set audio beacons that track your direction. At crosswalks, smart technologies are being developed that detect all road users, pedestrian and vehicular, with integrated safety notifications and AI algorithms that can predict the trajectory and speed of oncoming traffic. We were interested in tapping into advances being made in mobile robotics (such as MIT’s Spot project) to optimize National Landing’s 5G smart city infrastructure for capturing data and learning how and where to best assist people over time. Artificial intelligence can become a feedback loop that automates improvements in communication and public safety.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">This model of urban wayfinding has the potential to undo the sense of modern alienation that has defined urban living since at least the end of the 19th century, in which urban residents feel as the city does not care about them, and that they have to operate within this unfeeling, unresponsive metropolis. Will this smart system act as a ‘friendly local’ that can guide pedestrians?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Yes, we want visitors to feel welcome as quickly as possible and feel as though there is nothing prohibiting them from exploring the area upon arrival.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/63852344cfb1fd11ad99d76f_RSM-Design_National-Landing_Park-Building-Rendering.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2 id=\"\">National Landing as a model for other cities</h2><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It seems like what is taking place at National Landing could become a model for other American neighbors that are currently overly reliant on private automobiles for inner city transportation.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cory:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Absolutely. We were hoping to demonstrate to the residents of the Arlington and DC area that it is possible for an aging vehicular-centric downtown to be revitalized as a walkable city with multiple functions and a vitality that was not there before.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Shane:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">How do you see the placemaking and wayfinding applications gathered at National Landing as fitting within global benchmarks?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cody:</strong></h3><p id=\"\">National Landing sees themselves as a global leader in creating liveable, connected and mobile communities. The key aspects of placemaking and wayfinding are contextual layers that only those elements can support. Our team seeks to stitch together these layers of brand, direction, education, art &amp; culture, transit, commercial and entertainment to interconnect a community at all legible levels.</p>"

The short answer: from the start.</p><p>Graphics have always been an inherent part of architecture, making the language of patterns, words, signage, and narratives as much of a part of the community as the buildings themselves.

First, we’re starting with the origins, exploring how typography, patterns, and culture have helped create the architectural identity of buildings for centuries.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Graphic Design Connections to Architecture</strong></h2><h2><strong>In the Beginning</strong></h2><p>For centuries, architecture and graphic design have coexisted in the built environment, although each discipline has its own unique language. If you combine and meld them, they create a whole new vocabulary that can give a building its unique identity.</p><h3><strong>Ancient Egypt</strong></h3><p>Let’s go all the way back to hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt. Hieroglyphics used graphic, syllabic, and alphabetic elements to create characters and tell stories. However, these did not just act as storytelling—they also gave structures cultural identities that are still being studied today.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the centuries, uses, and structures have changed, we’re still seeing the same relationship between graphics and architecture. Classical inscriptions, figurative murals, and ornamental surfaces have all evolved over time to reflect the social and cultural climate of each changing era, becoming part of our visual heritage.</p><h3>‍<strong>Arch of Titus</strong></h3><p>Over the decades, these depictions evolved to reflect the social and cultural climate of each changing era, becoming part of our visual heritage. You can take a walk through any city and see graphic elements in architecture almost everywhere. Think of a city hall, or maybe your town’s library. While your city hall may not have the intricate carvings like the ones seen on the Arch of Titus in Rome, it may have similar carved inscriptions letting you know that it is a city hall.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6087039316026b8da34a4421_RSM-Design_History-of-Architectural-Graphic-Design_Arch-of-Titus.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Arch of Titus, Rome 100 AD.

Today, we are still using graphics in architecture to convey language and meaning through both two- and three-dimensional design. Architectural graphics woven into the environment solidify narratives, culture, and history, and build a <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/news/branding-wayfinding-and-creating-a-strong-community\">sense of community</a>.</p><h3><strong>1939 World’s Fair</strong></h3><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6087064f689947fd4f9a722a_RSM-Design_History-of-Architectural-Graphic-Design_1939-Worlds-Fair.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>1939 World's Fair.

Sussman vividly recalls her memory of the 1939 New York World’s Fair installation:</p><blockquote>“The famous ‘Trylon and Perisphere’ of the 1939 New York World’s Fair became another lasting icon for me. In this case, it was the form and its whiteness, its newness, its bigness, and its simplicity that lives in memory. It wasn’t architecture; it wasn’t really sculpture, and certainly not graphic design. So what was it? It did not fit into a category neatly. Could it have been ‘environmental graphic design’?”</blockquote><blockquote>– Deborah Sussman<strong>‍</strong></blockquote><p>Sussman helped to define what structures did not fit into a category, but still made a powerful impression. Now, the famous <em>Trylon and Perisphere</em> lives on in memory as the origin of modern environmental graphic design.</p><h2><strong>The Power of Typography and 2D Patterns</strong></h2><h2><strong>Graphic Architecture</strong></h2><p>The graphic design of typography, imagery, symbology, and art can tell cultural and visual stories, and oftentimes echo an architectural and cultural message.</p><p>The human desire to “dedicate” places is clearly the reason graphics were integrated into the built environment. Inscriptions, figurative murals, and ornamental surfaces have long been a part of architecture. These elements and concepts transformed over time, reflecting the social, political, and cultural climate of each period and becoming part of our rich visual and cultural heritage.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/609019a27eaf1f7783a63191_New_Rome.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Mussolini's Palazzo Braschi, Rome.

Compare <em>The New York Times</em> building in New York, the Arch of Titus in Rome, and Mussolini’s Palazzo Braschi in Rome. While the three structures bear little resemblance to each other culturally, politically, or geographically, they all use typography to tell their identity story.</p><p>The Arch of Titus is a religious honorific arch, whereas Palazzo Braschi was once the headquarters for Italy’s fascist party. Then you have <em>The New York Times</em> building, which tells you not only that it’s a prominent publication, but also that it is part of the very fabric of New York City.</p><h2><strong>Environmental Architecture</strong></h2><h2><strong>Coming of Age</strong></h2><h3><strong>Las Vegas</strong></h3><p>Las Vegas in the 1940s is a great example of how <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work\">wayfinding and signage are design elements</a> that can turn buildings into landmarks. Sure, the bright lights and typography gave you information and told you where to go—but they also helped to give Las Vegas its cultural identity.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/608707a2e2f2a1371e9d554b_RSM-Design_History-of-Architectural-Graphic-Design_Las-Vegas.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Las Vegas in the 1940s</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Santa Monica Place</strong></h3><p>Architects of the 1980s embraced using typography to solidify architecture brand identity. Take Frank Gehry’s Santa Monica Place in Los Angeles, for example. He used gigantic typography layered with chainlink to turn something that could have been ordinary into an iconic image that has been woven into the pop culture history of Los Angeles.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/608707fae87bfc492f3f6f31_RSM-Design_History-of-Architectural-Graphic-Design_Santa-Monica-Place.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Santa Monica Place.

That “simple” typography has made the museum truly stand out in a city full of iconic buildings.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/608708179d8faf27f2d3c26a_RSM-Design_History-of-Architectural-Graphic-Design_Seattle-Art-Museum.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Seattle Art Museum</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Universal CityWalk Hollywood</strong></h3><p>If you jump to the 1990s, Jon Jerde’s design for Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles also shows how signage isn’t just a simple addition to the architecture, or something that gets in the way of it—it is a crucial part of the design.<br></p><p>The engaging aspect about examples of architectural graphics is that they’re everywhere, in almost every city or town. Even now, we’re seeing some of the most exciting examples of architectural graphics yet—which is what we’ll talk about in our next blog post.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/608708336a311dbcf8fe1a32_RSM-Design_History-of-Architectural-Graphic-Design_Universal-CityWalk-Hollywood.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Universal CityWalk Hollywood</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Graphic Design Continues to Transform Architecture</strong></h3><p>Many aspects of the built environment—including urban streetscapes, office buildings, museums, airports, public parks, mixed-use developments, and entertainment centers—have been transformed by the integration of graphic design and architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although the discipline of architectural graphics was only recognized relatively recently, it has long been known not only for its functional improvements, but also for its integral relationship to changes in architecture, cultural movements, and art. This combination of the disciplines can shape our overall perception and memory of place and ultimately enrich our experiences with the built environment.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversations surrounding graphics in architecture are important. Graphic typography and texture can enhance architectural design in so many ways, and even turn a building into an iconic destination.</p><p>RSM Design's new book, <em>Graphic Connections in Architecture</em>, takes a deeper look at the synergistic relationship between engaging graphics and today's architecture, starting with the origins and going all the way to the future.</p><h6><a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/book/graphic-connections-in-architecture\">Graphic Connections in Architecture Book</a><br></h6><p>And remember—don’t miss the next blog post in this series.

Adjacent to the iconic TCL Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, this newly envisioned mixed-use complex is positioned to become the epicenter of the Hollywood experience.</p><p id=\"\">For close to a decade, RSM Design has collaborated with multiple development teams to repurpose and reposition the project formerly known as Hollywood &amp; Highland, and now re-branded as Ovation Hollywood. The goal was to open the public gathering spaces to Hollywood Boulevard and make the site and its amenities more inviting. The development has opened its doors to a more diverse collection of offerings, now including creative offices, a hotel, retail, entertainment, and dining destinations, creating a true mixed-use destination for tourists and the local community. RSM Design’s team was engaged to integrate identity, wayfinding, and specialty placemaking graphics into the whole experience, uniquely inspired and abstractly rooted by the past, present, and future of Hollywood.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/63ffb137dbb10c6cbdee5b8f_b01-RSM-Design_Ovation-Hollywood_Large-White-Letters.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">A refresh for the Hollywood icon</h3><p id=\"\">Since its origins in the early 1900s, the site has stood as a hallmark at the epicenter of Hollywood. During the 1910s, moviemakers discovered that the always-sunny climate of Los Angeles was ideal for year-round filming. It was at this time that many started migrating to the area, wanting to stay at the famed original Hollywood Hotel located on this site. But by the late 1940s, the hotel started to decline, and the land use began to evolve– ultimately becoming the largest development in the area, known as Hollywood &amp; Highland.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">For over a decade, developers have been trying to revamp the outdated center, confronted by many challenges. When recently acquired by DJM Capital and GAW Capital, and by putting nearly $100 million into the redevelopment, exciting things began to happen. One of the primary goals was focused on eliminating the former Babylonian-style graphic references and creating a space that was more inclusive and inviting to a larger audience. Ovation now features a dynamic and welcoming open plaza, murals commissioned by artist Geoff McFetridge, specialty graphics and wayfinding by RSM Design, and an overall design approach that feels contemporary, inspiring, timeless, and authentically Hollywood.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/64011d6588c6d010a297ac83_Images-Ovation-Eblast.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Placemaking inspired by Hollywood</h3><p id=\"\">While crafting the designs for Ovation, RSM Design was inspired by a juxtaposition of classic Hollywood meets the future and the evolutions of digital inspirations.</p><blockquote id=\"\">Graphic elements enliven the walls of Ovation, celebrating the artful nature of the community.</blockquote><p id=\"\">While celebrating the diversity and creativity of the local community, the specialty placemaking designs also pay homage to the entertainment industry and Ovation as the backdrop to the Academy Awards. As the development evolves to suit the needs of the contemporary audience, it was important for the placemaking elements to also adapt and appeal to a more diverse audience.</p><p id=\"\">The refreshed brand celebrates the future of new beginnings. At the new Ovation, the stage is set for everyone, and with the venue's inclusive and immersive design, everyone has a part to play in the show and deserves their standing ovation.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/64011dfcea23e6d46e1b3971_b05-RSM-Design_Ovation-Hollywood_Painted-large-ovation-logo-digital-directory.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Ovation is the ball gown, signage is the tuxedo</h3><p id=\"\">Within Ovation, the wayfinding is referred to as the \"tuxedo\", as it adds a touch of sophistication, classic elegance, and timeless quality, guiding visitors through the space while contributing to the overall atmosphere and aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Inspired by the timeless black tuxedo, the RSM Design team took an intentionally classic approach to graphic language. Through sophisticated materiality, timeless typography, and a bold but simple black-and-white color palette, the final design is both contemporary and ageless.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Ovation itself can be compared to the beauty of the ball gown….it's the showstopper. The overall environment is where the ambiance, atmosphere, and spectrum of opportunities all come together to create an unforgettable experience. RSM Design wanted to support the environment and the guest with elements that were both functional and fashionable but let the space take center stage.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/64011ea6be995123389b0e6a_Ovation-Eblast-Escalator-Directionals.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Wayfinding for 25 million annual visitors</h3><p id=\"\">In addition to feeling timeless and classic, another important principle of the signage design is clarity. Wayfinding is critical at Ovation to help the venue's diverse visitors navigate the large and complex space, particularly during peak weekends and evenings. To accommodate the diversity of visitors, the signage uses clear, concise language and universal symbols to ensure everyone can understand the directional information.</p><p id=\"\">The placement of signage was also carefully considered and positioned at key decision-making points, beginning at the entrances, parking structures, interior core, and exits. This strategic placement, woven into the architectural context, is intended to keep the visitor journey not only smooth and painless but exciting and delightful. Additionally, as a transformational day-to-night venue, many of the wayfinding elements use dynamic lighting as a navigational tool. Specialty placemaking designs were used as an integral part of Ovation’s overall branding and design language– contributing to the iconic status of this world-renowned entertainment destination.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Ovation Hollywood is a must-see destination for anyone interested in the history and culture of Hollywood...and wanting to be in a cool place! With its mix of entertainment, shopping, and dining options, it offers a unique experience that captures the spirit of this iconic Los Angeles neighborhood. Ovation is a celebrated venue that is playing a significant role in shaping Hollywood's entertainment landscape, with a focus on and applauding the diversity that makes Los Angeles so wonderful.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/64011facc330ab2a37c21b5e_Images-Ovation-Eblast-stars.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">‍</p>"

The sidewalk was essentially an extension of the shopkeeper’s business and neighborhoods were built on daily interaction with commerce and community. As the automobile flourished and cities began booming through arterials and freeways, the common sidewalk became more of a safety buffer between fast moving lanes and front doors. &nbsp;Recreational amenities have also been impacted by the evolution of cities. Parks were located in city centers as common amenities that gave people a reprieve and place to rest, recharge, and re-connect. Spines of streets, freeways and arterials have segmented the trails and path access in order to accommodate development.</p><p id=\"\">Flash-forward to today and the built environment is responding to the interest and value being placed on wellness and mobility. Real estate developers are investing in infrastructure that supports active lifestyles. Residential, retail and hospitality are seeing the benefits of having a well conceived and accessible development with multiple amenities. Environments we love are the ones that create a place that begs to be explored. Whether it’s the tree lined streets creating a pleasant walk, or an easy-to-navigate bike path connecting home and some place cooler than home; mobility is a highly valued amenity in new development.</p><p id=\"\">Gaps in the built environment have historically been the result of accommodating the car. Today the creative team at RSM Design is responding to client demands that are looking to put people back onto the streetscape by creating environments that support safe and easy to navigate paths. The team is working with clients to create wayfinding systems that support this new demand to discover and connect to places by bike, foot, or transit. There’s no question that an overall sense of wellness is being placed as a high priority on individuals seeking places to live and work.<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/196061/communities-built-active-living-healthier-residents.aspx?g_source=CATEGORY_WELLBEING&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles\" id=\"\">‍<br></a></p><p id=\"\">“Across 48 communities studied nationwide, residents in the five highest-ranked active living communities have, on average, significantly lower obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and rates of depression than do residents of communities with comparatively little active living infrastructure,” according to a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/196061/communities-built-active-living-healthier-residents.aspx?g_source=CATEGORY_WELLBEING&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles\" id=\"\">Gallup study</a> conducted in 2016.</p><p id=\"\">It’s no surprise that many of these places have strong housing options and an array of recreational amenities surrounding healthy job markets.

The purpose of placemaking is to develop environments that foster a sense of community and encourage communication among friends and neighbors. Public art, wayfinding signage, landscaping, lighting, and street furniture are just a few examples of the many design components that are used. The goal of placemaking is to create public spaces that are more livable, sustainable, and socially inclusive, thereby enhancing community health and well-being. Making public spaces safe, usable, and welcoming for everyone is another requirement of a great public space.

The creation of public spaces that reflect the beliefs, values, and traditions of various cultures has the power to bring together people of different backgrounds. A writer by the name of William Whyte first used the term \"placemaking\" in the 1960s. According to Whyte, it involves \"the planning, design, management, and programming of public spaces\" He thought that effective places required a thorough understanding of how people use public spaces, what engages or eases them.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/640b36a5ef62b81dc839a4aa_History-Placemaking-Design.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Colosseum in Rome, Italy is an example of placemaking dating back centuries\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Image Courtesy of <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@henrypaulphotography\" id=\"\">Hank Paul via Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Another important person in the history of placemaking is Jane Jacobs, an urbanist and activist who wrote extensively about the value of local communities shaping their own environments incrementally and organically. Jacobs' most famous book, \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" (1961), critiqued the large-scale redevelopment projects. Cities should be planned to support diverse communities and human-scale neighborhoods. Her concepts contributed to a trend of more neighborhood-focused urban planning and design, which still has an impact on placemaking today.</p><p id=\"\">Overall, the history of <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/services/placemaking\" id=\"\">placemaking design</a> demonstrates that many cultures and societies throughout history have placed a high priority on creating interesting and useful public spaces.

It can take many different forms, each must be customized for the particular needs of their community, stakeholders, and developers. The examples below are all waterfront projects in California, within 40 miles of each other, some even closer. Even with such close proximity, and similar surrounding, these projects take a varying approaches to placemaking design. There are 4 defined types of placemaking that can be used alone or with each other:</p><h3 id=\"\">Standard Placemaking</h3><p id=\"\">This strategy entails making physical upgrades to public areas to make them more hospitable and accessible places for people to congregate, play, and unwind. Pacific City in Huntington Beach, CA is directly across from the beach and provides restaurants, retail &amp; dining along with great views and public seating for a relaxing sunset experience.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f74ef05d2f98d6242569c71_n05_RSM-Design_Pacific-City.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Public seating area at Pacific City with Huntington Beach sand across the street and a beautiful golden sunset\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Strategic Placemaking</h3><p id=\"\">This approach is more focused on aligning placemaking initiatives with broader strategic goals and community needs, such as improving public health, promoting economic development, or addressing social equity issues. The City of Dana Point conducted a rebrand, redevelopment, and economic enhancement effort to stop themselves from being a pass-through city. They wanted to be the destination, and they have done just that. Dana Point is thriving with new developments, city run events, and premium amenities for all residents and guests.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5fac6a73a51bad2c41762385_b07_RSM-Design_City-of-Dana-Point_Street-Sign.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Dana Point's free PCH Trolley driving toward the beach with flag sign and directionals across the street\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3 id=\"\">Creative Placemaking</h3><p id=\"\">This approach emphasizes the role of arts and culture in placemaking, using creative and artistic interventions to transform public spaces and engage the community.

We have to remember that over 40% of this generation are having families which are rapidly changing the market needs and expectations.</p><p>Within RSM Design, we are constantly searching on how to reflect the needs and soul of these communities in which we design. At the center of our practice is Connecting People to Place™, uncovering the soul of a place to create meaningful connections to the people who occupy them. We believe that life is a celebration of connections, a series of everyday socially shared experiences that benefit loyalty but also the triple-bottom line.</p><p>We have found that the root of all great experiences and memories are the journeys that bind them. These journeys are opportunities for the developer, architect or designer to connect the market to a place. They become a series of curated moments that bind each of us to one another, to a place, an idea or a common experience. Placemaking is the glue that permeates these touch points and offers tangible and when done correctly, intangible moments, memories and sensational connections to a place.</p><p>In our experience, Millennials are driving change through a vocal upwelling around what is important to them… a generation centered around shared objectives.

In short, the new mixed-use core is about traditional “community engagement.” A social and economic environment that is a platform for binding communities together. This successful recipe connects us on a holistic, whole-person paradigm, addressing our mental, spiritual, physical and emotional desires. This human motivation in design allows us to pinpoint key human factors during our design process. We weave this hierarchy of needs seamlessly into the design of a place. &nbsp;We call it “Certainty, Variety and Delight,” and we concentrate on these three elements to simplify and focus our design intent for every project to create a rich, layered experience rooted in the needs of a specific community.</p><p><em>“We are more aware of how our actions impact the larger community. We live in an increasingly urban world where more people are choosing to live in cities and forgo the suburban lifestyle.”</em></p><p>As Architectural Graphic Designers, we are concerned with understanding the user experience and infusing that into our design process. We have developed a clear methodology for multi-modal projects that binds the fundamental human needs with the practicalities of transit-oriented design. We know that the journey experience is a loop cycle and often begins at home, weaving continuously through pre-journey, arrival, discovery and return home scenario. These journey touch-points are design opportunities for us to tap into trip planning, clicks to bricks, social or event planning or even transit connections. This element of journey time leads us to create advanced branded marketing to on-site landmarks (meeting points), communal social spaces, artful and playful experiences and holistic architectural as “engagement” to reinforce shared community, storytelling and wayfinding systems.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f498e11cbfcc739dcecff9a_n08-RSM-Design-Planes-Trains-Autos-06.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p><em>“Our generation grew up knowing all about the effects on the environment that cars can have, so we’ve grown up with an attitude of wanting to do our part for the earth – something that we can easily do with public transit and not with cars.”</em></p><p>RSM Design is featuring three multi-modal projects that are at varying timelines of development.

The mixed-use project embraces Miami’s Metrorail station and incorporates bus and shared ride transfers into a dynamic assemblage of retail, hotel, and transportation. The vertically oriented project combines these uses in an efficient way to create a dense and compact development. The team at RSM Design has been engaged to bring all of these uses together through a complete branding, identity, wayfinding, and art program that touches upon all of the varied uses. The art and graphics interventions will link the Metrorail Station with the development and with the Underline linear park to create a vibrant new destination inspired by one of Miami’s newest linear links.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f49911d741dff752a579921_n11-RSM-Design-Planes-Trains-Autos-Jack-London.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h3><strong>JACK LONDON SQUARE</strong></h3><p>Location: Oakland, California</p><p>Client: CIM Group</p><p>Transit: Alameda-Contra Costa Transit, Oakland/South SF &amp; Easy Bay Ferry, Bay Trail and Local Bikeways</p><p>RSM Design is working with CIM Group to help brand and design Jack London Square, a historic district along the Oakland waterfront. Named for the writer Jack London, the neighborhood is undergoing a revival and was in need of a vision, brand, and signage and wayfinding program. Centered around Water Street, RSM Design worked to create a logo and brand, as well as a vocabulary of collateral to use throughout. A system of signage and wayfinding helps guide visitors throughout the area and helps define the area, and the also helps accurately define the boundaries and destinations within the small district. In addition, RSM Design worked on streetscape concepts to help revive the waterfront area. Together, the vision, branding, and signage helps to share the rich history of the district and is bringing in more visitors to the area.</p>"

Image Credit: Allison Richter Photography</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>We Use the Built Environment to Choreograph and Craft Architectural Graphics that Send a Message</strong></h3><p>Architecture speaks of space, form, place, and function while architectural graphic design communicates a building’s function, purpose, message, and narrative. Effective and appropriate architectural graphic designs support the statement made by a building and strengthen its presence. The graphics layered into the environment are derived from the architectural context, spatial context, cultural context, and historical context to &nbsp;which they relate. They are not independent nor superficial. The design elements provide meaning, form, function, and purpose, along with the architecture. Whether these architectural graphic designs are woven into the building or space through identity signage, wayfinding signage, specialty features, or graphic embellishments, there is an open dialogue that mutually benefits one another. <br></p><p>Architectural graphic design creates a strong sense of place, fulfills human needs, helps &nbsp;users find their way, and communicates a building’s narrative, fostering a strong connection between the person and place. The relationship of architecture and graphic design is a symbiotic alliance that orients, informs, and delights. </p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f6a823451a8d8147232502a_n03_RSM-Design_Principle-Centered-Design.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68f2ee64e98f81c369a95e_n04_RSM-Design_Principle-Centered-Design.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h3><strong>A Principle Centered Design Approach</strong></h3><p>The primary guiding principle of RSM Design’s practice is that people are at the center of everything we do. Whether you think of people in terms of individuals, groups, or communities, they are inherently at the center of the architectural graphic designer’s focus. &nbsp;</p><p>Our goal with any project is to help people to feel good, to give them a sense of meaning in their environment, and to help them identify within the community that will build an enduring and lasting connection. <br></p><p>When visitors look at a place, drive up or walk through it, the work of architectural graphic designers is what helps make it unique and identifiable, and more importantly resonate with its purpose. People want to feel good about putting their energy into the environment and be a part of it.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f68f321731dc0838e699a44_n05_RSM-Design_Principle-Centered-Design.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Liberty Station, San Diego, California. Image Credit: Allison Richter Photography</figcaption></figure><p>We want people to feel empowered by the spaces they occupy. So, how do we invigorate the environment to make it more engaging and create the kinds of connections that surpass the physical?<br></p><p>We place people at the center of the design process. Everything revolves around understanding the core needs, values, and objectives of the people that will occupy the space. It’s all about their motivations &nbsp;and desires. We create brands, wayfinding, signage, and artful moments that engage the psychology, spark memories, tap emotions. What we’ve learned over the years is that subtleties in design, a different typeface, color choices, the placement of a piece of art can totally transform the experience.<br></p><p>Places have the power to become part of &nbsp;a person’s identity, particularly when they &nbsp;are authentic, when they stand for something. Making that connection requires a deeper &nbsp;level of sensitivity and understanding. A colorful sign won’t do it. To be effective, our work has to engage at every human &nbsp;level—the body, the mind, the heart, and &nbsp;the spirit. It’s a whole-person approach that radically defines the work we do. </p><p><a href=\"http://rsmdesign.com/news/experiential-design\"><strong>READ PART 1: EXPERIENTIAL DESIGN</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"http://rsmdesign.com/news/connecting-people-to-place\"><strong>READ PART 3: CONNECTING PEOPLE TO PLACE</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"http://rsmdesign.com/news/certainty-variety-delight\"><strong>READ PART 4: CERTAINTY, VARIETY, DELIGHT</strong></a></p><p><br></p>"

It was enlightening to be a part of conversations that recognized that retail is not dead, as one might believe from the North American press. Across many different lectures and presentations there were a few consistent themes that resonated amongst the international roster of speakers: retail is in a renaissance, convergence of digital and brick &amp; mortar retail, omnichannel retailing, transformation, evolution, and the curated experience.</p><p>It was also encouraging to see examples of how retail projects within Latin America truly have evolved to become centers of the community and mixed-use environments that are important destinations and gathering places within these communities. The line appears to blur between commercial importance and civic responsibility. This convergence of uses and experiences is also seen in the blurred lines of the digital retail experience and the physical retail experience of the traditional brick and mortar stores. Both Neil Stern of McMillan|Doolittle and Skyler Fernandes &nbsp;of Venture University had interesting talks on the blurred lines of the two platforms citing many examples of how retail is transitioning….from retail to hospitality with a Muji Hotel in Shenzhen, retail showrooms such as B8ta in Santa Monica, renting clothes from Le Tote, and having breakfast at Tiffany’s in New York.</p><p>Bad retail is dying. Good retail is thriving and is incredibly exciting. It’s a fascinating time to be in the middle of this inevitable transition in the industry and see how experiential retail is creating some engaging and creative mash-ups. Retail has always changed and this evolution is just a part of the natural cycle of our consumer-based economy. It was interesting to learn that 60% of the people in Latin America are below 37 years old and it’s great to be observing how the retail industry is evolving to cater to Millennials, and Generations X, Y, and Z.</p><p>‍</p>"

It was hard, but it was the right thing to do, considering the pandemic. During that time, we noticed a longing for reconnection. They were craving in-person connection. The workshops had always been a crucial part of our company’s culture and connection. So when 2022 rolled around we knew it was time to re-gather. And, it was going to be the 25th anniversary of RSM Design. It was a no brainer.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d8e771fee661b3d6fef7d_1A_RSMDesign_SwagItems.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d8e831b1436081dff7487_1B_RSMDesign_SwagItems.png\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">DRAFTING UP A PLAN</strong></p><p id=\"\">Planning began with our internal team in the early half of the year.

Robin led the team through a <a href=\"https://www.discprofile.com/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">DiSC</strong></a> workshop, which uses a personal assessment tool to recognize patterns in our communication and collaboration styles.

With over 25 years of experience in both the education and professional design realm, Tyrone discussed the benefits of working in teams to come to creative and innovative design solutions. He shared an inspirational story of his experience guiding students through a UX/UI project during a study abroad program in Berlin, Germany.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=\"\">Our final speaker was <a href=\"https://www.thokocreates.com/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Thokozani Mabena</strong></a>, who shared his touching journey as a designer coming to America from Zimbabwe.

These exercises brought various groups together to explore ideas such as product design, user testing, listening, creative design practices, and more.<br></p><p id=\"\">You may have already seen our Egg Drop Challenge shared on social media. This is one of those activities that you may have done in your high school science class. But the Egg Drop Challenge also explores a number of design thinking principles: how to design and prototype an effective container solution that will safely protect a fragile egg as it drops from an elevated surface. We were divided into teams and each received a mystery bag of tools and props. Together we used communication and creative thinking to design egg containers, made of popsicle sticks, pipe cleaners, marshmallows, paper bag scraps, and our favorite mystery item: a jar of peanut butter.<br></p><p id=\"\">We presented our containers to the judges, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/team/harry-mark-faia\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Harry</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/team/martin-e-schwartz\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Martin</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/team/suzanne-redmond-schwartz\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Suzanne</strong></a>, before dropping them off of our studio balcony. Some eggs survived the fall, and some didn’t. It was a lesson learned for all of us. Ultimately “Pineapple Express” took home the prize as the most effective as well as design forward egg drop container.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=\"\">In addition to the Egg Drop Challenge, we also hosted a range of activities from design trivia to DIY pennant flags, a curated design book library, What’s in Your Wallet? (all about empathetic listening and why we hold on to the things we do), and a field trip to a neighborhood artist and friend, <a href=\"http://www.jpgreenwood.com/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">JP Greenwood</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d9640b7b454236cbef66b_5A_RSMDesign_Workshops.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d96522e11a1a9a71fcdce_5B_RSMDesign_Workshops.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatleft\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d96702a427c7c9484cf3f_6A_RSMDesign_Workshops.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatleft\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d96802a427c186b84e033_6B_RSMDesign_Workshops.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3855px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3855px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6372e0c437e3fce0a6d81184_Compressed_GIF.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">We converted our conference room into a “maker’s space” for team members to step away and work with their hands.

As many of you already know, this year RSM is celebrating 25 years of creative collaboration in the environmental graphic design and place branding industry. Those 25 years have shaped our company into what it is today. And our people are at the very center of that. Under a starry night sky, we went back to our Texan roots (fun fact: Harry, Martin &amp; Suzanne met in Texas!) and celebrated those 25 years with a BBQ dinner, popped the champagne, and in true Texas style, line danced our achy-breaky hearts away. The truth is, we wouldn’t be able to do any of this without you. We’re so grateful for the opportunity to come back year after year and be a part of incredibly inspiring projects. Thank you for making the past 25 years memorable + exciting. It’s a lucky thing, we love what we do.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d9c428147961b7cd72dd3_8A_RSMDesign_Workshops.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatright\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d9c514a50ecae0f3529d3_8B_RSMDesign_Workshops.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatleft\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d9c6204d9091feced481a_9A_RSMDesign_Workshops.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"floatleft\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636d9c70c43358720fc07c8c_9B_RSMDesign_Workshops.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><blockquote id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cheers to 25 years and definitely s’more adventures ahead!</strong></blockquote><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6372e39c53c89078adf113b8_11_RSM-Design_Photobooth.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">See more from our workshops on our <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rsmdesign/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Instagram</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/rsm-design/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Linkedin</strong></a>!</p>"

This unique project was designed to enhance the guest experience by increasing activity levels in the stadium zone not only on event days but keeping it a desired entertainment destination on non-game days as well.

The graphics palette consists of contemporary abstractions of sports themes with the overlay use of historic materials such as steel and brick that reference back to materials used in the local area. Additional specialty concepts that enhance this local aesthetic are kiosks created out of sustainable shipping containers and the integration of a local artist inspired mural system that identifies the rich history and legacy of the city, sports teams and the community.</p><p id=\"\">As the project continues we look forward to adding more layers of exciting graphics to enhance the experience at Philly Live!</p>"

In a time when everything is shifting and we’re being restricted in so many ways, people are craving spaces to (safely) connect, to run free in nature, and find a new way fulfilled, whole and well. It’s the opposite of Joni Mitchell, instead of paving paradise to put up a parking lot, we’re finding out what happens when we un-pave the parking lots and put up paradise.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f90a6a73c6a8fe4471ea37e_TPpLqaUc_2x.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Project: Airport Park, Hawaii &amp; Playa Vista Parks,Playa Vista, California.

We quickly realized the consistency of continuously blank slates that were almost always flat, with a few trees, and some purposefully planned, very bland buildings. Other than that, we could count on a lot of asphalt, concrete and efficient infrastructure. With the goal of bringing life to these environments by creating landscapes that want to be lived in and interacted with, our biggest question was how do we bring these massive properties down to a human scale. By establishing welcoming, inviting environments, we create spaces that people feel good about being in – we make what was once impersonal extremely personal, with an identity, a sense of fun and an engagement that nods to the past while looking toward the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f90a7eff7cfbc2a81a570bb_alamedapoint.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Project: Alameda Point, Alameda, California</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f91d71cf8f6f45c0acbb876_alameda-point.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h5>‍<strong>Alameda Point</strong></h5><p>Originally the Alameda Naval Air Station, <a href=\"http://www.waterfrontaction.org/plans/alapoint_project.htm\">Alameda Point</a> sits on 878-acres of waterfront land with dramatic views of the San Francisco Bay. The initial development includes 800 housing units and 60,000 square feet of commercial space in the former air station’s World War II-era buildings. The focus is on a new main street, parks, and low-rise residential with maker spaces and a collection of wineries and breweries, dubbed “Spirits Alley.”</p><p>With so many elements present, we developed the branding and identity as a foundation and uniting element for the project. At first, water was the obvious theme – the site sits on a stretch of coastline with views of the city – but further research uncovered a rich history that included a thriving Victorian-era community and a stint as a Pan-Am terminal in the ‘30s.</p><p>Ultimately, it’s the runways and connection to aviation that invoke a pride in America and link to an exciting past. However, identity can’t stay stuck in nostalgia and this project has to connect with different generations, attracting families and diverse groups alike.</p><p>A palette was developed to capture the richness, nostalgia and warmth of the environment, while still connecting it to current demographics. The branding and logo brought together core elements of the project, highlighting each unique district, making the individual part of the whole.</p><p>Additionally, a full activation program was developed around concepts that could inspire, educate, and entertain a landscape full of active lifestyle enthusiasts, families, urban professionals, artists, and students. With the target audience identified, we decided on temporary installations like food trucks, a container park, and key spaces to create and capture shareable moments, in addition to art and community events, all designed to bring Alameda Point to life with a very special sense of space.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f90a7518d98efbddd2acbeb_runways_military.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Project: Great Parks Neighborhoods, Irvine, California.

The eventual result was the Orange County <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/great-park-neighborhoods\">Great Park</a>, a groundbreaking plan to turn the unused air base into an arts and sports recreational center. At 1,300 acres, the park itself would be bigger than New York’s Central Park or San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, including its 688 acres of parkland and 175-acre sports facility.</p><p>The challenge here was how to bring a sense of scale and identity to a completely new space. With the project evolving and so many different entities and individuals closely invested in its progress, the design process had to be open, inclusive, and highly flexible. As new neighborhoods come online, new designs are constantly needed today.</p><p>The City of Irvine, a seminal Southern California master-planned community, already had a distinct look, feel and culture, but the Great Park’s development team wanted to instead create a new, low-key identity separate from Irvine. The team specifically wanted to avoid the look and feel of California’s gated communities, with big entry monuments, a closed-off feel and cookie-cutter vibe.</p><p>Each area of the park is different and was developed with a different theme, tying in a universal emphasis on walking and biking. All the wayfinding elements – pedestrian and bike signage, trails, and educational moments – communicate and reinforce the overall identity while celebrating and defining each unique area. On every level, the park must present a comfortable and secure environment in order to draw families and active young adults from the surrounding area.</p><p>At the same time, there also has to be an element of whimsy and adventure. A special emphasis was placed on random and unexpected moments that would make people smile, allowing for a level of variety and delight that would give the new park personality and distinction. Hand-painted signs and benches are used to create a sense of neighborhood, an organic space that reflects the people who live there.</p><p>Playing on that, we discovered new opportunities throughout the site to create new environments. Lights were strung from mature trees and a large viewing deck was built into a grove of jacarandas. Big shade structures were designed to define spaces, allowing for mixed-use. Every element provides more occasions for people to connect while continuously encouraging them to explore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f91d66469d753958b5ba5f2_Liberty-Station.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Project: Liberty Station, San Diego, California </figcaption></figure><h5><strong>Liberty Station</strong></h5><p>In San Diego, more than 1,75 million young men and women passed through the Naval Training Center on their way to service in the Navy. The base is emotionally connected through generations, a heritage that plays a large role in today’s Liberty Station, a 361-acre mixed-use development with several distinct retail, commercial, artisan, and residential districts.</p><p>On the National Register of Historic Places, the Spanish Colonial Revival buildings help give the project its distinctive style. The goal of the branding, wayfinding, and identity process was to represent this history and the site’s place in it, while still connecting to authenticity of local tenants and artisans in order to create a holistic, modern experience.</p><p>A cohesive plan was developed to create special places throughout the site, to develop easy navigation for pedestrians, bikes and cars, and to bring life and personality to the growing community. As a result, every element in the identity is clean and contemporary. The logo and branding are focused on the timeless anchor, distinctly invoking nautical roots in a contemporary way. Entranceways define the spaces and signage invites exploration while connecting the different districts.</p><p>A human scale was brought to the different blocks, including areas devoted to artisans and small businesses. Throughout the project, spaces were created to encourage people to gather and linger, while monuments and icons highlight the project’s character and uniqueness, providing opportunities for shareable moments. Art, banners and graphics all work together to cohesively remind people they are in a historically&nbsp; and culturally special place.</p><p><br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f91dd9c0def12bff9728ec1_Playa-Vista.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption>Project: Playa Vista Parks, Playa Vista, California</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these Runways to Parkways projects, we have worked on Airport Park on the big island of Hawaii, and <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/playa-vista-parks-los-angeles-ca\">Playa Vista</a>, home to Howard Hughes’ private runway for his aerospace empire.

The design team worked to develop a color-coded set of icons and bilingual information to create a legible and consistent layout for wayfinding at the site. A key aspect of the design process was several stakeholder workshops in which the designers engaged with community leaders and members of the public to address the needs at the border crossing. During those guided conversations, the team studied the overall feelings towards the former destination. Attributes such as <em>confusing</em> and <em>unsafe</em> bubbled to the surface, making it clear to the team that the <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/services/wayfinding-signage\"><strong>wayfinding signage</strong></a> would need to create clarity at the site– ultimately leading to a safer overall environment.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61944b538175d260ce1d0f92_San-Ysidro_RSM-Design_1.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/61944b62574ee45050964c46_San-Ysidro_RSM-Design_2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><h2><strong>Balboa Park Signage Masterplan</strong></h2><p>In 1835, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/balboa-park-masterplan-san-diego-california\"><strong>Balboa Park</strong></a> in San Diego was designated as one of the country’s oldest historical sites for public recreational use.

It is one of the most dramatic and largest industrial sites on the United States’ east coast. The steel plant operated for over 100 years and manufactured steel for such notable structures such as the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, U.S. Supreme Court Building and the Golden Gate Bridge and many others before being decommissioned in 2001. It is great to see this area begin a new chapter in its development, and one that successfully bridges historic preservation and new growth.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f6243fdedb60ed6edc16d65_n02-RSM-Design-Sand-Casino_02.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>RSM Design’s branding and environmental graphics approach was to abstractly reference the industrial heritage of the site while combining it with a contemporary feeling set to create a thriving resort destination for a cutting-edge audience. The sign designs drew their inspiration from the site’s authentic industrial wayfinding, existing structures and historic artifacts that are then complimented with fresh and modern designs. The steel production process is referenced in the graphics with the use of unique materials and colors used which can be seen in the dotted arrows, use of steel and warm colors which can be seen in items such as the directionals and project materials, and layered abstract industrial patterns used to brand and define the project’s unique zones.</p><p>RSM Design is pleased to be a part of the revival of the Bethlehem community’s pride in their history with the recent opening of the Sands casino. We look forward to the second phase of development with the opening of the hotel, events center and retail mall.</p>"

The last thing I want to do is turn to a formula.</p><p id=\"\">From the speakers at the conference, I kept hearing talk about the role of designers as advocates for users. Within a team of consultants, the role of Environmental Graphic Design (EGD) is unique in its reliance on a temporal and physical understanding of the experience. One of the speakers, Frost Collective’s <em id=\"\">Urbanite Studio</em>, presented a process for diagramming these needs, using the rubrics of <em id=\"\">Think, Feel and Do</em>.</p><p id=\"\">As designers, we have a unique capacity to abstract this empathic view of users — to draw it out, break it down, and share it in a way that others can understand. How we translate the user’s point of view is an important part of the process. If leveraged right, this approach can guide decision-making in a transformative way.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Wayfinding Aesthetics: Standing Out vs. Blending with the Context</strong></p><p id=\"\">Within the discipline of wayfinding, the lens has typically focused on complex spaces, such as municipal, transit, and hospital applications. Within these environments, the type of users and information has created a strong universal vocabulary that aims, first and foremost, for clarity.</p><p id=\"\">The visual language is highly systematized with an analytical approach to messaging, legibility and the organization of information. From the roster of speakers, the Milksenar studio most fits into this view of wayfinding. One idea that they strive for is to be unnoticed.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4defc988994f87014485_n03_RSM-Design_RSM-Design-Reacts.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">What struck me at the end of the day is the range of approaches that were shared. Wayfinding today bridges a spectrum from this international modern approach to more eclectic styles represented in the work of the studios, Egg and Newsom Gonzalez.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4e01c9889965c0014fa5_n04_RSM-Design_RSM-Design-Reacts.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Within each of the environments reviewed, the users and their goals varied widely. The priority on intuitive approaches to wayfinding as presented with the University of Southern California project, for example, &nbsp;suited the needs of that client and user group. Where the memorable landmarks as shown in the &nbsp;Facebook restaurants campus dovetailed with a more neutral background of hardworking, simple wayfinding elements.</p><p id=\"\">The diversity of design reflected the varying needs of our client groups and the abilities of the teams to tailor the application to address those needs. Clearly, there is no one size fits all.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Tory Hoffman, Designer</strong></h3><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Active Member in SEGD Community</em></h4><p id=\"\">I particularly enjoyed the presentation Christian Daniels from EGG gave on their work at the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, CA. I feel there were a lot of valuable insights he shared that can be translated into our everyday work environments. The site was a challenge because of its mile-long scale and the wayfinding strategies that the designers implemented were very functional and engaging… and cool! I particularly liked the maps on the floors showing you exactly where you were standing in the overall building, and I think walking through there and seeing your progress on the maps would probably be a truly great wayfinding experience (you think you’ve walked a long time but that dot hardly moves!). The simplicity of the wall signs also recalls how Facebook used to be: very simple, clean, and easy to navigate.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4f3259a838eb82b1c90c_n06_RSM-Design_RSM-Design-Reacts.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Another exciting part of their presentation was when the team talked about the design of each of the restaurants and their identities, especially <em id=\"\">Full Circle</em>. They went through so many iterations of the designs, easily could have stopped at any of them and come out with a fine solution, but kept pushing their ideas into further development and ended up with something that was probably better than imagined – Fiestaware as signage has never been more fun!</p><p id=\"\">The conference was inspiring because I feel that many times when I come up with a solution that works, it’s like an end game for me. However, if I continued to push through and continue working on it, better results are created. Time doesn’t always allow for that but it’s a good reminder that if you take the time to do more, things do get better, and that the first good answer isn’t always the best.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Katie Hollman, Designer</strong></h3><h4 id=\"\"><em id=\"\">First Time at SEGD&nbsp;Event</em></h4><p id=\"\">I did not know what to expect for my very first SEGD event. It felt great to be in a room full of other people who have the same passion as I do. All the presenters had a unique way of sharing their work and creativity. It was interesting to see which projects used a cleaner and simpler approach and which ones used more detail in the design.</p><p id=\"\">I feel every job has its own personality based on what the client wants in the end for the user. Airports, college campuses, and city wayfinding were some of the projects presented that had a clean, bold, and modern approach. It makes sense because in these environments the user is getting from one place to the next and we as the designer want to make that path as simple as possible. Our end goal is for the user is to not have to think too hard about how to get to their destination.</p><p id=\"\">Projects that have more detail and complexity are very different than basic wayfinding. Memorials, art districts, company headquarters, and restaurants can be very hip and detailed. You are there for a reason and usually are not passing through, so the user has time to take in the surroundings. The use of different materials specific to the project can be a game changer. For example, the plate wall at the Facebook headquarters cafeteria was, of course… designed with plates!!! I find myself overthinking projects like these because I want them to turn out super cool and to be memorable. If you take a step back and think more simply it can be a great help.</p><p id=\"\"><br></p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4f7958270935faeaad8d_n07_RSM-Design_RSM-Design-Reacts.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4f985c98d6093053e474_n08_RSM-Design_RSM-Design-Reacts.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4fa3f340a679c6823982_n09_RSM-Design_RSM-Design-Reacts.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">The presentation that EGG shared stood out to me. The designer was in architecture school on the east coast. He found himself wanting more… more creative freedom, a new environment, and a new perspective on design. I was in Madison, WI wanting the same things.</p><p id=\"\">He spoke a lot about getting off the computer and out of the office to find inspiration in everyday life. Moving from Wisconsin to California, I found inspiration in places I never would have seen if not for the trip. Sleepy tiny towns in the mountains to rooftop bars in Hollywood gave me a spectrum of everyday design. There are many different lifestyles in the world and within those lifestyles is design to fit that community. Seeing how experiential design reflects a specific population is key knowledge to have while connecting with clients and their ideas. You have to experience different cultures and communities to create exceptional design.</p>"

Located on a 10,000-acre site adjacent to the New River Gorge National Park Area, the Summit is a unique high-adventure camp. The identity and wayfinding signage program, developed by RSM Design, was designed to guide scouts and visitors to the site amenities and campsite areas. RSM’s program responds to the natural context of the site as well as the crafted qualities of local materials, mixed with the contemporary attitudes of the adventure activities to create unique juxtapositions within the sign designs. Sign components were designed to be inexpensive and flexible, with no extraneous material usage or superfluous detailing.</p>"

Their work successfully created subtle breaks in the massing, evoking a warm and inviting experience that shapes the quintessential “hang-out” spot. Lot 579, an indoor food-hall with unique culinary casual faire, provides additional dining to enhance a more communal and playful coastal vibe. Foosball tables are arrayed along the boardwalk-inspired planked areas within the project. Developers went the extra mile to ensure boards in wooden walkways squeak and creak just like an authentic pier boardwalk. Every detail is designed to create an authentic seaside experience as a pause from the shopping and buzz of this new paradise by the Pacific.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f52b1fa44d31919a1e38ed4_n05-RSM-Design-Coastal-Identity_paccityillum.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>Neon and bulb-lined signage elements paired with reclaimed wood and contrasting white-washed walls give this picturesque site a well-balanced blend of modern, hand crafted and fresh flare. The distinct collection of artisans, restaurateurs and shopkeepers were carefully curated to complement the mood envisioned by the developers as the perfect sunny, catch-all beachfront destination. The signage elements maintain a rhythm of the consistent theme, coupled with enough variety to add moments of delight and surprise.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f52b2d1dc30fc10b61d84c2_n06-RSM-Design-Coastal-Identity_paccitydirectional.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>RSM Design also worked to create transitional elements and temporary signage that would allow for staging and storytelling of the exciting elements to come. From a wood block 3D map to the interactive chalk wall, you’d be hard pressed to find something that doesn’t compel a return visit. These bold graphic statements are a choreographed teaser for guests and work to inspire those classic <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rsmdesign/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram moments</a>.</p>"

The South Berkeley Library was a great way to look back on those times and focus on the workshop as a place of imagination. The bright yellow-orange at the heart of the palette is inspired by the same orange seen on tape measures, Stanley screwdrivers, and countless other icons of the handyman’s garage. For the letters of the canopy signs, the measuring tape was abstracted into the return of the letterforms. The sides were intentionally left open, allowing internal illumination of letters on the raceway without the usual, horsey backplate typically used in such sign types. The recessed ‘halo’ illumination technique was also carefully chosen to consider the residential neighborhood location of the sign. This same formal detail was used on the internal way finding signs, connecting the project with a strong look that expressed the distinctive attributes of the location.</p><p>It was a great pleasure to work on this project with Yann, Avery and the team at Field Paoli. They encouraged us to make the graphics and signage bold, expressive and fun.” Inside people filled the aisles, browsing the collection and getting to know the library staff. The main atrium space, a bright and open area with high ceilings and lots of natural light, buzzed with excitement .</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f52cf4c01faa9aa150cd0c3_n03_RSM-Design_South-Berkeley-Library.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p>Category signs were developed to be eye-catching, but allow for transparency. Drawing again from the workshop as inspiration, the dot pattern that appears throughout the interior signage was informed by garage pegboards.</p>"

From small scale to large scale, these considerations make the difference between a spot that people simply pass through and a location that becomes an integral part of the community. These ten ideas branch out of just environmental graphics and include all disciplines that go into making outstanding public spaces, from landscape and architecture to developers and city planners.</p><h2 id=\"\">1. A SENSE OF ARRIVAL</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4f419427af595211b716_n02-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_02.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">The Tustin Legacy archway in Tustin, California</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Knowing you’ve arrived at your destination is the first step in experiencing a space. This sense of arrival can be a huge, iconic gateway, such as the monument and arch at the Tustin Legacy, or a more subtle gesture such as different colored signage for every district in a master plan. Regardless of the scale, it should be clear to visitors that they have arrived where they meant to navigate to. This “a-ha!” moment is not only practical in the sense that it announces the beginning of a place, but it is an opportunity to mark the start of a brand experience that will be carried into and throughout the entire project.</p><h2 id=\"\">2. THE HUMAN SCALE</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4f604bbedf8fd115274b_n03-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_03.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">The Moreno Street Marketplace entrance of Montclair Place (Montclair, CA) was outfitted with an eye catching mural, as well as smaller moments that lead into the entrance, including a colorful crosswalk, an illuminated identity sign by the door, and branded paving across the elevated walkway.</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Walking into a big space can be intimidating. Without signage or landmarks to help guide you, it can be easy to feel lost and confused. Humanizing the spaces we work in by focusing on the micro-scale inside of the macro-space has a profound effect on not only logistical wayfinding but also in creating spaces that are engaging and fun. Visitors will be able to discover a new surprise every time they walk through. It also provides an opportunity to spice up even the dullest parts of a project, like lamp posts, back entrances, water fountains, parking garages, or restrooms.</p><h2 id=\"\">3. WHAT’S THAT SMELL?</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d4f7c41df41f1da93d4c3_n04-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_04.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Hotel Zaza Memorial City (Houston, TX)</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Engaging senses outside of sight can be a valuable asset to a project. It’s common knowledge these days that scent can play a big part in affecting our mood (see: the rise in popularity of essential oil diffusers) and some developers have begun to take that into consideration in the planning of their projects. &nbsp;RSM Design worked on the <strong id=\"\">Hotel Zaza</strong> in Houston, Texas where the owner reached out to the luxury fragrance maker, La Labo, to engineer on of their scents, Santal 33, to be diffused throughout the hotel via the air vents. In this case, the scent was used to invoke a sense of luxe, but smell can also be used to relax, energize, or make us hungry (we’re looking at you, Cinnabon). Even utilizing plants like lavender in the landscape of outdoor spaces can help solidify the memory of a space in visitor’s minds.</p><h2 id=\"\">4. MUSIC AS A DRIVER</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d51c7922b7c9b22abfa53_n05-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_05.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">The fountain at Oakbrook Center helps create a relaxing and engaging retail experience (Oakbrook, IL)</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Music and sound plays such a vital role in our everyday life. Even used in a subtle way, the right music can drive shoppers to stay longer in a store or restaurant. There are even services, such as <a href=\"https://noonpacific.com/about\" id=\"\">Noon Pacific</a>, which have begun specially curating playlists for public spaces and businesses to help drive activity. Even the soothing sound of a fountain can transform a typical shopping experience into a relaxing afternoon. While music can be a driver to attract visitors to a space, it can also be used subtly to deter certain activities from taking place. The managers at a retail property RSM Design worked on in Irvine found that after working hours, the public spaces around the building were being used for illicit activity, creating an unsafe environment and causing damage to the property. They began playing classical music outside the building overnight, and the activity stopped. It’s just not “cool” to break the law to Mozart!</p><h2 id=\"\">5. “MY BENCH”</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d51f11711311ab1a1f1f0_n06-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_06.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">A variety of eclectic seating at Lido Marina Village in Newport Beach, CA</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">In many classical Costa Rican town centers, you can survey the area and see a plethora of different benches and seating options. While from a design perspective it may be more aesthetic to have a set of the same benches, from a wayfinding and placemaking perspective, RSM Design has found that a variety of benches makes it easier for people to identify their location and feel connected to a space. Finding “your bench,” or the one place you know you can always have a seat and know where you are.</p><h2 id=\"\">6. SHADE</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d52082be6a1e2bd0fd95c_n07-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_07.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">An artistic intervention at The Pools (Great Park Neighborhoods, Irvine, CA) that provides shade over a walking path and seating.</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Shade can be easily planned into an outdoor space from just about any design discipline. From architectural awnings and canopies, to shade trees and umbrellas, there are so many ways to ensure that people are comfortable sitting and walking in the outdoors. RSM Design has worked on a number of projects where environmental graphics were directed to include shade. We have designed shaded wayfinding directories, patterns for glass awnings, and interventions such as playful canopies for parks, artful installations with shade, even bus stops that include overhead graphics.</p><h2 id=\"\">7. SECURITY</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d56968fc3fd8ac710f5fa_n08-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_08.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">A playful but clear and informative regulatory sign at Pavilion Park (Great Park Neighborhoods, Irvine, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Accounting for security in a space can mean something different to everyone. For some, having good lighting at night means the difference between feeling able to walk home and deciding to call a ride. Walking to your car in the depths of an underground parking garage can be made to feel much more inviting if the walls are painted a light color. Having clear directions and a safe way to navigate a larger area can turn a confusing and stressful journey into an exciting adventure. Even touches as simple as clear and legible regulatory signage can help visitors feel safe in case of emergency.</p><h2 id=\"\">8. QUIET MOMENTS</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d56b11711311427a2aba4_n09-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_09.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Children enjoying a calming moment away from the hustle and bustle of the Victoria Gardens shopping center (Rancho Cucamonga, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">The hustle and bustle of a crowded public space can be draining for some people. Although it’s rare to plan a space dedicated to solitary activities, it’s important to set aside some areas where it’s easy to sit down, take a breath, and have a quiet moment to yourself. These interventions can be anything from seating with a nice view, or a pond with beautiful greenery around it. Landscaping, fluid forms, even comfortable seating or calming music can create a sense of serenity within the chaos of a crowded space.</p><h2 id=\"\">9. SHARED SPACES</h2><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d56c8c9889912ea05a0b1_n10-RSM-Design-Placemaking-Power-of-Ten_10.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">A scenic shared space at Pacific City (Huntington Beach, CA)</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">When we think about creating a “shared” space, we consider two main angles. The first is the physical space and how different people from many parties and places will be able to co-inhabit the space. Designing a space that help communities bond over a shared experience not only breeds relationships and a sense of closeness, but also leads to the second angle of sharing– <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/creating-social-media-places/\" id=\"\">social media</a>. Creating spaces designed to be shared on social media is a new phenomenon with the advent of Instagram and other photo-based platforms. When visitors post images and videos of themselves enjoying a project, it in turn drives more people to come and experience the project for themselves.</p><h2 id=\"\">10. TURN THE ORDINARY INTO THE EXTRAORDINARY</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/63728fd9129dd4e400f808b6_RSM-Design_Museum-Garage.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Museum Garage, a parking garage decorated by a number of artists at Miami Design District (Miami, FL), gives new life and purpose to an every day parking garage.</figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Probably the most exciting part of our job as environmental graphic designers is the opportunity to turn ordinary, every experiences into something extraordinary. These moments can be big or small; an empty plaza can be made exciting by putting a huge dancing fountain in the middle of it, or a water fountain can have a nautical-inspired pattern on the splash tile; transforming light poles into yarn-bombed works of art, or putting inspirational quotes and images on the wall of a parking garage. Anything from bike racks, garbage bins, building facades, and regulatory signage is fair game for a little bit of fun, and these moments of delight are what help create memorable and lasting moments for visitors.</p>"

Our new mission statement reflects both the diversity and unity of the team, and our new logo takes it one step further.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5814b830a6de82b121b61b_n01-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_01.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Martin gathering the team during our WHY kickoff pow wow.</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f58178828d3e28d054f29a5_n03-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_03.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Generating our core beliefs and key words.</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f58179a1fd8d45231de6ab3_n02-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_02.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h3>STARTING WITH WHY</h3><p>We approached the rebranding of our own logo as we would every project, starting with the “Why.” After reading Simon Sinek’s <em>Start with Why </em>as an office, we decided to reevaluate our mission and core beliefs to figure out Why exactly we were all here. In order to do this, we started with a brainstorm, asking all team members to participate in filling in the blank “we believe…” as well as voting for key principles that individuals felt strongly represented RSM as a design firm and as a brand. Through this collaborative and sometime messy process, we discovered key words and core principles that we could all get behind, as individuals and collectively as a firm. You can find out more about our “Why” <a href=\"https://development.rsmdesign/about/why/\">here</a>.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f58171ea8b7ce7a7c94de1f_n04-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_04.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><h3>ALIGNING THE TEAM</h3><p>After clarifying our new and refined mission, the next step was to create a graphic representation of our purpose and beliefs. Let’s just say it’s a lot easier said than done. Starting with our original logo, we began to experiment and try new things. The whole office participated in generating ideas, and the final result is truly a product of multiple authors, not just one designer. The new logo reflects the unification of the team under a single mission: connecting people to place. The merging of the dots represents a single vision as well as collaboration and teamwork, which are integral to the way we work. It also represents alignment among the leadership and team members. The transforming colors of the logo reflects the diversity of our ideas and team members, as well as reflecting the fact that we like to have fun in our office.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5817b90636a3d1c0699029_n05-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_05.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Evolution of the RSM logo.</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5819ad0636a3380c6ae958_n07-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_07.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5819b81fd8d46931debf93_n06-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_06.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5819c4be0aeceac5cc0fce_n08-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_08.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f581b2711a59227796ac6db_n09-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_09.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f591c9fea55d636494d60cd_n10-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_10.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Ideas for RSM “swag”</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f591cb49f6921511a037527_n11-RSM-Design-Evolving-the-RSM-Brand_11.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Even our screensavers got a refresh.</figcaption></figure><h3>REFINING THE PROCESS</h3><p>Overall, the process was not an easy one, but oftentimes designing for yourself can be the hardest thing to do! This was truly a team effort and every member of the team had a role in shaping the RSM brand.

We believe that our new brand reflects the creativity, problem-solving and fun that is RSM Design. <a href=\"mailto:hello@rsmdesign.com\">Give us a shout!</a></p>"

RSM Design has the privilege of working with Laguarda.Low Architects and Mane TCI on the latest retail center being built in Albania’s capital city, Tirana. Named Tirana East Gate based on its location in the eastern part of the city, the designs and architecture were inspired by the vibrantly colored buildings that make the city drastically unique to eastern counterparts. The project’s signage and specialty graphics fearlessly use color combined with layers of translucency that capture the feeling of a brilliant culture on the rise. RSM Design met an interesting challenge to choose, coordinate and design for European prefabricated interior sign systems. Based on a selected interior sign family, RSM achieved harmony between the juxtaposition of custom designs and standardized forms. We are excited to see this vivid project come to life!</p>"

The Cow Parade is the world’s largest public art event. After debuting in Chicago in 1999, more than 250 million people have seen these famous cows. Over a decade and 5,000 cows later, the parade spans across the globe, reaching every state and most countries, offering local artists a chance to create a statement utilizing the terrain of a cow’s anatomy.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f52a3b718ed524ac7198833_n02-RSM-Design-Using-Public-Art_thecows.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Photo Credit Infrogmation of New Orleans</em></figcaption></figure><p>Much has changed since 1999 and the value and perception of <a href=\"https://development.rsmdesign/work/services/public-art/\">public art</a> has evolved into something quite different.

Using blighted streetscapes, cracks in walls, broken curbs and abandoned buildings as creative inspiration, Banksy transformed the way in which pop culture and political cartoons reach an audience. The documentary “Exit Through the Gift Shop” released in 2010 exposed street art to a new generation. Once considered graffiti and a public nuisance, public street art is now purchased by celebrities and rock stars, sold as high-ticket items by such reputable art houses as Sotheby’s.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f52a40701faa9085a0442cb_n03-RSM-Design-Using-Public-Art_dragonmural.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>Photo Credit Ryan Sharp</em></figcaption></figure><p>The change and evolution of <a href=\"https://development.rsmdesign/work/services/public-art/\">public art</a> can be attributed to the community of everyday people turning into art curators through the use of technology and social media, Calum Sutton, the head of a global communication agency, recently told Business Life Magazine. “With the growth of social media, everyone is now a photographer and looking more closely at their environment,” Sutton said. “It would follow that <a href=\"https://development.rsmdesign/portfolio/the-collection-riverpark-public-art/\">more businesses are seeing the value of commissioning excellent public art</a> to help both define their buildings and engage with their audiences.”</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f52a5f3b2da157434c44024_n04-RSM-Design-Using-Public-Art_planterseating.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>From concept to final – public art at The Collection at Riverpark in Oxnard, CA</em></figcaption></figure><p>As environmental graphic designers, working in the built environment alongside architects and developers, we shape spaces that make a lasting impression, providing people with a memorable moment that reminds them where they are, how they arrived and why they want to come back.

As the discipline matured, it has become much more integrated into architecture and EGD designers have found a variety of creative and synergistic ways in which it could be expressed.</p><p>During the 1970s and 1980s the practice of weaving graphics into a project underwent something of a rebranding and became known as “environmental graphic design.” During this time it gained increased acceptance as a specialty practice within the architectural design industry. At the time, the word “environmental” was easily accepted as being synonymous with “your immediate surroundings” – the word had yet to adopt today’s primary definition of conservation, climate, and the natural world. As the word “environmental” evolved in the lexicon of everyday life, the EGD field began to experience identity issues. Even as the acceptance and integration of environmental graphic design expanded, it became increasingly difficult to introduce the concepts to those unfamiliar with it, as the idea of being “green” had usurped the more immediate definition pertaining to one’s surroundings.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f47e09b5dc5dc0867e0f431_n03-RSM-Design-What-is-EGD-Part-1_times-square.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption><em>New York’s Times Square in 1945 and 1983, in contrast with today’s Times Square (below).

And although the consistency in the acronym may help the discipline regain its previous foothold of awareness, the description may still come up short in truly describing everything EGD encompasses today.</p><p>Even as the recognition of the discipline is evolving, the presence and proliferation of environmental graphic design is undeniable. The role of EGD in visitor’s experiences within the environment has become absolutely vital. Why does environmental graphic design have such a profound influence on an experience?

Whether you call it environmental graphic design, experiential graphic design, or architectural graphic design the objective is similar…helping people make connections with the places they visit and inhabit. By doing so this increases their ability to identify with these places, making these places their own, thereby uniquely connecting on a visceral and emotive level. The principle of “Connecting People to Place” provides some insights to the intention behind environmental graphic design and the countless ways in which EGD can facilitate these connections. However, at the core of every one of these ways to connect is a single driver – human need.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/636c00ed059d9370b7c25a14_Web-Img_Full-2-3_Short.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">As designers we explore three types of criteria when developing EGD programs: certainty, variety, and delight. All three are designed to satisfy human need on one or more levels. When considered alongside Maslow’s pyramid of human need, the concepts of certainty, variety and delight help provide a lens through which to evaluate the potential success of proposed solutions. The two base layers of the pyramid cite physiological and safety needs as the most critical of human needs. EGD elements such as <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/blog/what-is-wayfinding-4-part-series/\" id=\"\">wayfinding systems</a> act as guides to built environments and experiences. By identifying entries, exits, escape routes, and helpful directional information, these guides satisfy those first two layers of the pyramid. With the assurance of safety, visitors can relax, enjoy the space, and then be receptive to other elements designed to address the upper portions of the pyramid which involve love, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. In total, these elements add up to a more positive emotional connection with the place because they allow more access to the experience – they enhance it by helping one get to it, understand it, and feel a level of ownership in it.</p><p id=\"\">The primary guiding principle of our design practice is that people are at the center of everything we do. Whether you think of people in terms of individuals, groups, or communities, they are inherently the reason behind most every built environment. The audiences are nuanced in terms of demographics or psychographics but most importantly all have human needs. Regardless of who these people are or where they come from, the goal is to help a user “feel” a place – to translate brick and mortar into narratives that help people make meaningful and personal connections to a place. We approach the psychology of connecting people to place through four attributes:</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"normal\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f46eeedd4af2638d49d58a3_n03-RSM-Design-What-is-EGD-Part-2_4-attributes.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Mental Connection (IQ): </em></strong>The ability to think, reason, problem-solve, and comprehend</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Physical Connection (PQ):</em></strong> Connection to our bodies and health as well as our ability to maintain and develop a balanced state</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Emotional Connection (EQ):</em></strong> The ability to communicate, interact and socialize with others and be self-aware</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Spiritual Connection (SQ):</em></strong> Connection to ideas bigger than ourselves and the ability to think creatively beyond what we see and experience</p><p id=\"\">These four principles as applied to the built environment cover all of the human needs.

But in a broader context wayfinding should be considered in all the disciplines – architecture, interiors, landscape, lighting, and yes, signage and graphics. But the graphics, the sign system, the information systems, those are just the tip of the iceberg. In fact, if the iceberg is built with wayfinding in mind, then the tip might be just barely visible above the waterline.

At heart, wayfinding is a system of elements working in concert to provide assistance. The goal of any <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/wayfinding-design/\" id=\"\">wayfinding design</a> system should be to aid the user in orienting themselves in a space and then in navigating to a specific destination. In Polynesian cultures, that meant navigating the open ocean by careful observation of the stars and planets. An article from <a href=\"https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2014/03/03/hokulea-the-art-of-wayfinding-interview-with-a-master-navigator/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">National Geographic</strong></a> describes how, with these few consistent and organized cues from the environment, the Polynesians were able to successfully navigate thousand of miles of the Pacific Ocean long before the existence of GPS or even maps, for that matter. The celestial bodies and their relationship to Earth was decoded by these ancient wayfarers who then used their knowledge to navigate an unforgiving environment where getting lost carried with it the ultimate consequence. Theirs was a situation in which safety (and the ability to return to land) was paramount – the fundamental purpose of wayfinding was safety, which brought with it the confidence to venture out – to leave the island in search of something more.</p><p id=\"\">Thousands of years later, the same basic human needs are still at play. <a href=\"https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/abraham-maslow/\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Abraham Maslow</strong></a> is best known for his 1943 paper, “<a href=\"https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm\" id=\"\">A Theory of Human Motivation</a>,” where he establishes and outlines the five basic human needs. He organized the five principles into a pyramid with each layer relying on the presence of the layer below it. The base layer of <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html\" id=\"\">Maslow’s pyramid</a> is Physiological Needs – food, water, warmth, rest. With those established, humans can move to the next layer; Safety. These two first layers represent the basic human requirements. After that, Love and Belonging (intimate relationships and friends) and Esteem (prestige and feeling of accomplishment) constitute the Psychological layers of human need. The last portion of the pyramid is Self-Actualization where creative activities and the realization of one’s full potential can be realized. In design, this pyramid of need must be accounted for as these principles are driving forces connecting &nbsp;people to place. And when people feel connected to a place they feel fulfilled and are more likely to return.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d3093462aecb9b2af6eda_n03-RSM-Design-What-is-Wayfinding-Part-1_certainty.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Certainty Variety Delight.

Every day we rely on architecture, signs, landscape, landmarks, lighting, and a host of other cues from the built <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/environmental-graphic-design/\" id=\"\">environment</a> to assure us that, first and foremost, our basic human needs are being addressed. By feeling confident about the safety of our surroundings we’re able to relax – there’s a certainty to it that makes us feel comfortable. With Certainty, one can let their guard down, begin to decipher the layout of the environment, notice the landmarks, the signs and begin to understand the space. Many aspects of a project bring Certainty to the experience – architecture, lighting. Sign systems, often called wayfinding signage systems, provide a great deal of it. These systems identify uses and direct traffic. Maps, arrows and labels all provide Certainty. They decipher the environment for the observer.</p><p id=\"\">Once Certainty covers the basic needs, Variety steps in to keep things interesting and begins to address the needs of Maslow’s Psychological layers. Variety may be used to establish the prestige or authenticity of an environment and can be expressed as shifts in color, pattern or texture which may denote zones or neighborhoods and serve to break the overall experience into smaller, more human-sized chunks. Features in the Variety classification can add color, visual interest, or meaning to the experience. When used hand in hand with Certainty, Variety also aids in the cognitive mapping of an environment – it’s another layer of memory. The third classification is Delight, which is just that; delightful experiences along the way – like a sculpture or a mural – which add to the overall wayfinding experience in more subtle ways. These points of interest can act as landmarks or come to symbolize a node. They usually inform the personality of the place and often bring with them culture, history, and education.</p><p id=\"\">Maslow’s theory and our application of it to Certainty, Variety and Delight begin to define wayfinding from a viewpoint of need – effectively answering the question of ‘What is it?’ to ‘Why do we need it anyways?’</p><p id=\"\">In the next chapter of the series we will look at the modern city as a model for organizing and engineering a <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/wayfinding-design/\" id=\"\">wayfinding system</a>.</p>"

While this &nbsp;model is organized around the context and features of a city, it can be applied to most <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/environmental-graphic-design/\">built environments</a> – for example a shopping mall also has paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d35208228656450b01d7e_NewLynchGIF.gif\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>When you layer each part of the Kevin Lynch model you are able to clearly identify logical sign placements.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Paths, Lynch tells us, are “the channels along which the observer customarily, occasionally, or potentially moves. They may be streets, walkways, transit lines, canals, railroads.” These channels provide the framework for wayfinding as they directly facilitate movement. The success of the design of the paths in a given city heavily affects the overall wayfinding profile – Manhattan is an easy to decipher grid. One can easily infer the route necessary to get from 53rd Street to 61st Street. The design of the paths in London is not easily decipherable as the layout grew organically without an underlying principle and thus it has a more difficult wayfinding profile.</p><p>Edges act in many ways as the counterpoint to paths. The edges of a city are not confined to the perimeter according to Lynch, but instead “are the boundaries between two phases, linear breaks in continuity; shores, railroad cuts, edges of development, walls.” (Lynch p.47) Edges restrict movement rather than facilitate, but they find their purpose as organizing elements.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f5f933363d15558879fc6d3_n05_RSM-Design_What-Is-Wayfinding-Pt-2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption>Image Credit: Jorge Fernandez Salas on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>Lynch calls Districts “medium-to-large sections of the city, conceived of as having two-dimensional extent, which the observer mentally enters “inside of,” and which are recognizable as having some common, identifying character.” (Lynch p.47) Districts break the city down into smaller, more digestible pieces which aids the observer in gaining better understanding of both the relationship between the pieces and the details within each piece. Districts provide variety – one part of the city just feels different from the other parts and the transition from one part to the next provides clues to the observer that can then be used to navigate.</p><p>Nodes are essentially intersections or the hubs of a city. Paths lead to nodes and thus they are intrinsically linked to one another. But nodes can also be more than simply the overlap of paths – they can be the concentration of some use or physical character. Some of them, Lynch says can be “the focus and epitome of a district, over which their influence radiates and of which they stand as a symbol.” Times Square in Manhattan is a node of the city in which the use has come to define the district. A concentration of theaters created a very competitive environment in which marquees, signs, and now screens vie for the attention of the observer. There’s no sign defining the beginning or end of Times Square, but you know whether or not you’re in it.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3499px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3499px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4d356bbdf0cc3c5094003b_n04_RSM-Design_What-Is-Wayfinding-Pt-2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>The Tustin Legacy archway (RSM Design) serves as a landmark for the city of Tustin, sitting at over 30′ high.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lynch’s &nbsp;fifth type of element is Landmarks. Like districts, Landmarks are a point-reference, according to Lynch – “but in this case the observer does not enter within them, they are external.” They may be grand in scale (a mountain or a building) or smaller, like a park or a statue. These consistent clues provide the observer with a reference point from which direction or position may be established.</p><p>The Lynch model provides us with an excellent framework on which to build – and the concept can be applied to most types of environments. Airports, lifestyle centers, stadiums, and campuses alike each have their own paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks. RSM Design uses the application of both the Lynch model and Certainty, Variety, and Delight to identify opportunities to intentionally foster and highlight not only the core wayfinding strategies but all layers of the experience through the use of color, pattern, texture, language, materiality, signage systems, murals, and sculpture. The clarification of paths, the definition of districts, and the introduction of landmarks are all potential contributions to the overall experience.</p><p>Wayfinding is everywhere in the built environment and acts at multiple scales at once. At the city level it exists in the design of the transit systems, signage, streets and sidewalks, to name a few. A large <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/sports-and-entertainment-design/\">entertainment</a> complex has its own ecosystem of wayfinding. Airports are notorious for their wayfinding. Everything from <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/higher-education-design/\">campuses</a> to train stations to <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/retail-design/\">retail centers</a> are each maintaining their own ecosystem while playing a role in the larger context of the district or <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/city-signage-design/\">city</a>. At some point the scale shifts from the vehicular to the pedestrian level. Libraries get very specific about their wayfinding and supermarkets get somewhat deceptive about theirs. Layered experiences of wayfinding occur right up to your front door. Those experiences may be good and imageable, and thus useful for <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/wayfinding-design/\">wayfinding design</a>, or they may be poorly planned or executed and not useful at all.</p><p>In the next chapter of the series we will look at the all of the different components beyond physical signage that come together to communicate a cohesive <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/wayfinding-design/\">wayfinding system</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p>"

Because our example is a mixture of retail and residential components it will likely attempt to do both – to expose the retail while partially obfuscating the residential.</p><p id=\"\">This split personality begins to drive wayfinding decisions – will the retail and residential parking be separated? Will they share a common entrance? How will motorists and pedestrians access the site? How will they exit the site? The design of the building and the relationship of the building relative to its surroundings establish the foundation for wayfinding – sometimes the site and building are so well designed to support intuitive navigation that very little else is needed. If the architecture is communicating Certainty then navigation though the space becomes intuitive. With too little Certainty the wayfinding is hampered and must be supported by signage. Too much Certainty and there’s no intrigue – no Variety or Delight. Of course, various project types will require appropriate amounts of Certainty. In our mixed-use project there’s a need to draw customers to the retail as well as to the residential leasing office, but there’s an equal amount of need for privacy for the residents. How can design in architecture, landscape, lighting, and signage work to meet these simultaneous needs?</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:5184px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"5184px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/6372889fc9b6511feb84d551_daniel-sinoca-3TwYtzQ2yKw-unsplash%20(1).jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Landscape and lighting elements play important roles in providing cues to the observer. They work effortlessly, both individually and in unison, to define paths, identify nodes, and give character to districts. The landscape design can literally show the way by channeling traffic and the presence (or absence) of light in an environment can communicate the message. Both landscape and lighting are excellent sources of Certainty, Variety, and Delight as they use color, shape, and texture to provide cues to the observer – they help translate the architecture in a non-verbal language spoken fluently by humans around the world.</p><p id=\"\">The signage and graphics system is also a vital part of the wayfinding system. In many cases, signage is the lifeline of a wayfinding system. Buildings gesture, lighting and landscape enhance and direct, but in complex situations it is usually the signage people look to when uncertainty emerges. This dynamic likely adds to the misconception that the term wayfinding is referring explicitly to the signage in an environment. In fact, the more an environment is designed to facilitate wayfinding, the fewer number of signs are required. The signage system merely decodes the environment for the observer. If the <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/environmental-graphic-design/\" id=\"\">environment</a> decodes itself for the observer then the need for signs is decreased.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4983debf5e90d98f5c0f3e_n03_RSM-Design_What-Is-Wayfinding-Part-3.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">Signage can be broken down into four classifications: Directional, Informational, Identification, and Regulatory. Directional signs typically point the observer towards one or more destinations. If it has an arrow then it’s probably a directional sign. Informational signs work directly with Directional signs to communicate the bulk of wayfinding messages. Maps, diagrams, and indices are the heroes of the informational signs. When paired with the directional signs, they can answer the two most vital wayfinding questions: “Where am I in relation to my destination?” and “Which way do I go to reach my destination?” Occasionally, directional and informational signs are combined into a single unit, but they are also effective as individual distinct elements.</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f498408a7c85725514c8a56_n04_RSM-Design_What-Is-Wayfinding-Part-3.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">This monument sign at Cadence Park in Irvine, California (RSM Design) marks the entrance of one of many parks within the Great Park Neighborhoods.</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">Identification signs label things: the range in scale and use of these is vast – a modest electrical closet sign is an identification sign but so is a set of twenty foot tall channel letters bolted to the side of a building. Identification signs are generally inviting. Or helpful at least. They say “here’s your destination – you’ve arrived!” Regulatory signs, however, are the lawmakers – “No Parking. No Exit. Don’t do that.” Regulatory signs do the least work in wayfinding. They add to the Certainty by establishing rules and order but do little else in showing the way.</p><p id=\"\">In signage systems like Legible London, maps are used in both macro and micro scales to aid observers in locating themselves in and navigating through neighborhoods of twisting streets. The consolidation of information and the consistent and clear delivery of the information made Legible London the benchmark for wayfinding signage systems. <strong id=\"\">Tim Fendley</strong>, the creative director of Legible London makes the point that Legible London had a special ingredient; “Most importantly, from a practical point of view, Legible London has something that the Islington maps do not, an index. It is what millions of visitors ask of the map immediately upon reading it – “Where is this street?” “Where is this landmark?” An index is a quick and easy method of decoding a map for those people.” Legible London presented beautifully designed signs and maps but it went further to help the observer understand the information. In doing so, they encouraged Londoners to walk more which not only eased the pressure on the transit system but additionally increased healthy habits and public safety (an increase to the number of people on the sidewalks deters crime).</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f498425bf5e9012355c1fcc_n05_RSM-Design_What-Is-Wayfinding-Part-3.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><figcaption id=\"\"><em id=\"\">“The consolidation of information and the consistent and clear delivery of the information made Legible London the benchmark for wayfinding signage systems.”</em></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">One of Kevin Lynch’s five elements, Landmarks, is an often overlooked wayfinding system element. Not quite architecture, not really a sign, landmarks sometimes occur by design and other times by chance. Maybe some driving need of the architecture creates an abnormality that stands apart visually and by doing so is memorable. Or a piece of <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/placemaking-public-art/\" id=\"\">public art</a> is placed in the project making that location special, and thus memorable. Lynch cites several characteristics of effective landmarks and notes, “Since the use of landmarks involves the singling out of one element from a host of possibilities, the key characteristic of this class is singularity, some aspect that unique or memorable in the context. Landmarks become more easily identifiable, more likely to be chosen as significant, if they have a clear form, if they contrast with the background, and if there is some prominence of spatial location.” Some landmarks, like a tower or a spire, can be seen from many vantage points making them especially useful in helping to orient the observer. The effect of Landmarks is powerful, especially to those repeat users of space. Lynch notes “There seemed to be a tendency for those more familiar with a city to rely increasingly on systems of landmarks for their guides – to enjoy uniqueness and specialization, in place of the continuities used earlier.” Navigation through the use of past experiences and visible landmarks becomes the fastest of wayfinding strategies as the observer no longer must stop or even slow down to read and understand messages on signs.</p><p id=\"\">In the next and final chapter of the series we will look at the future of <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/wayfinding-design/\" id=\"\">wayfinding design</a>.</p><p id=\"\"><br></p>"

The observer is led, in real time, through a sequence of decision points along the path to a destination. Real working examples of this type of technology are difficult to find, however. The implementation of these systems presents project teams with major obstacles to overcome in both planning and cost. The foundation required for this type of system lies outside the boundaries of most real estate development projects. Software development is seldom budgeted for in the beginning stages of a project and the long term maintenance of these types of systems creates uncertainty in financial planning. Additionally, software designers are not likely to be part of the <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/architectural-graphic-design/\">architectural</a> project team which creates more uncertainty.

Forty percent of those visitors come from out of the area so navigating the 4.2 million square feet of <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/retail-design/\">retail</a>, <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/foodhall-design/\">restaurants</a> and attractions for the first time presents real wayfinding challenges. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisaannegrimm/\"><strong>Lisa Grimm</strong></a>, MOA’s Digital Brand Manager says “We are interested in providing enhanced layers of usability for guests, and guest experiences are of primary importance. With the visitor numbers and square footage we have, there are several different problems we try to solve and address for our guests–and there are different fluency levels for them.” In this case, an existing facility is able to get over the technology gap through the <a href=\"https://mallofamerica.com/press/press-releases/OCTOBER-23-2017\">partnership with Google</a> which eliminates many of the uncertainties in both implementation and maintenance. For now, the use of the digital solution acts as a layer in addition to the traditional signage wayfinding system. As Grimm points out, today there are varying levels of fluency for this type of solution so both are required.</p><p>Will we see the traditional signage system fall away as the digital solution gains more traction – both in implementation and adoption? How, where and why will the next revolution in wayfinding take place? Three sectors seem likely to incubate the movement: Retail, Health Care, and Transportation. <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/project-types/retail-design/\">Retail</a> brings the promise of sponsorship dollars which addresses the issue of cost in the development of digital solutions. The Health Care sector is undergoing rapid expansion as the baby boomers arrive in their golden years but will they, as a group, value the addition of digital wayfinding solutions? Will Transportation give us the next big leap in digital wayfinding? In the past, transportation has pushed boundaries of wayfinding but the pollination of government and digital solutions rarely yields optimal results. It seems highly likely that digital solutions for wayfinding will become more ubiquitous over time. The questions lie in how and when.<br></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:3500px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"3500px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/5f4998122edd452d03d795c1_n03-RSM-Design-What-is-Wayfinding_Part4-03.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\"></div><figcaption><em>University of the Pacific Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California (RSM Design)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Wayfinding is a critical part of our everyday modern experience. In built environments, layers of wayfinding systems occur simultaneously – sometimes overlapping and at other times leaving big frustrating gaps. And while many people use the terms wayfinding and signage interchangeably, wayfinding systems are actually aggregates of architecture, lighting, landscape, art, and yes, signage systems. The consistent cues identified by Lynch as the lifeblood of wayfinding can be planned and designed into many aspects of the environment and environments that rely on signage alone for wayfinding are bypassing many of the most effective wayfinding tools available.</p><p>The environments in which we find ourselves are communicating on many levels. As wayfinders we’ve learned to filter the cues from the environment; to listen to the architecture, the landscape, the lighting and the sign systems. We’ve learned to see the relationships between these elements and to understand their cumulative message. As <a href=\"https://rsmdesign.com/work/services/wayfinding-design/\">wayfinding design</a> evolves further and becomes more intentionally woven into the environment, we may actually begin to see traditional wayfinding cues – the signage system – become less significant as other features begin to take on more responsibility.</p>"
