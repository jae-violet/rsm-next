RSM Design creates brands, urban landmarks, and wayfinding systems that match the city for vibrancy and spirit.</p><p>Take, for example, the brand identity, wayfinding, and placemaking design we created for Miami Baywalk. Over the 16-mile stretch of waterfront walking and biking paths, we designed fixtures from lighting to landscaping, as well as interactive installations from seating and shade structures to sculptures and art. This project was honored in Fast Company’s 2019 World Changing Ideas Awards.</p><p>Or consider our sign program for the Miami Design District. In the District, public art sits alongside retail shops to add a dynamic layer of character to the area, as well as to aid in navigation and a visitor’s sense of place. From sculptures and architectural façades, to storefronts, hand-painted murals, and whimsical moments of delight, the District has curated an atypical, highly creative retail destination. To sit alongside these master works and luxury brands, we took a sculptural approach, creating an interactive and tactile directory that places a focus on the district as a whole, as opposed to individual buildings and locations.</p><p>We take a custom approach to every project, and create work that feels at home in the local culture and context.</p>,<p>Miami, FL</p><p>Orlando, FL</p><p>Longboat, FL</p><p>Palm Beach Gardens, FL</p><p>Tampa, FL</p><p>Boca Raton, FL</p><p>West Palm Beach, FL</p><p>Coconut Grove, FL</p><p>Gainesville, FL</p>,branding-logo-design; exhibit-design; environmental-graphic-design; placemaking; wayfinding-signage; master-sign-programs; public-art-murals; digital-integration,,,,,,Florida Region

We’ve enjoyed more than our fair share of these. But, in the daytime, the city shines just as bright.</p><p>When designing Nashville brands, RSM draws not only from the aesthetic of country music, but from the city’s rich history. When crafting cultural exports, we aim for not just twang but tweed (Nashville is home to half a dozen celebrated universities). When envisioning new environments to support Nashville’s booming tourism industry, we think beyond music halls to Southern hospitality, with hotels infused with charm.</p><p>While recognizing these dualities, we’re never of two minds. We bring the same expertise and well-honed process to every project — whether it’s a luxury resort or a parking garage, a Michelin Star restaurant or a food truck. This process lies at the confluence of heart and soul, skill and verve. It’s what has earned us the trust of some of Nashville’s greatest brands and destinations, and it will continue to light our way into the city’s future.</p>,<p>Downtown Nashville</p><p>The District</p><p>Germantown</p><p>Jefferson Street</p><p>The Gulch</p><p>Hillsboro Village</p><p>Music Row</p>,branding-logo-design; environmental-graphic-design; wayfinding-signage; placemaking; public-art-murals; master-sign-programs,,,,,,Nashville Tennessee Region

It’s not just that we know the city like the back of our hands; we make our knowledge manifest through wayfinding and signage programs that help anyone feel like a local.

It’s obvious where we developed our nostalgia for <a href="https://rsmdesign.com/work/pacific-city-specialty-graphics">surf</a> and <a href="https://rsmdesign.com/work/seaport-village">sea iconography</a>. But less obvious are how we’ve inherited our penchant for play from the residents of San Diego, and how on their behalf we’ve taken up the mantle to move traditionally indoor spaces into the open.</p><p>Like the city, our studio comprises a melting pot of tastes and cultures. While some of our designers are SoCal natives, many others bring unique perspectives and experiences from the rest of the country and the world. What we all have in common is the belief that what you get from your environment, you should give back tenfold.

Yet, DC is the city most open to experimentation in public education, urban planning, and community organization. In this context, it feels like RSM Design never <em>stops</em> getting things done.&nbsp;</p><p>In proximity to the halls of power, where American might and aid are dispatched to the world, our team keeps things local. We roll up our sleeves and join hands with local agencies, changemakers, and the public to design new pedestrian spaces, civic centers, and neighborhood destinations.&nbsp;</p><p>Environmental graphic design can’t be exported wholesale. Connecting people to place requires firsthand knowledge of the built environment, an appreciation of the human experience, and wisdom about the relationship between the two. Our designs strike a balance of reverence, relevance, and resonance. Armed with this expertise, RSM Design unites with DC to pave the way to the future.</p>,<p>Capitol Hill</p><p>Riverfront</p><p>Columbia Heights</p><p>Congress Heights</p><p>Georgetown</p><p>Woodley Park</p><p>Maryland</p><p>Rosslyn, VA</p><p>West Virginia</p>,wayfinding-signage; placemaking; donor-recognition; branding-logo-design; public-art-murals,<p><a href="/markets/civic-design">Civic Design</a></p><p><a href="/markets/cultural-design">Cultural Design</a></p>,,,,,Washington DC Region
