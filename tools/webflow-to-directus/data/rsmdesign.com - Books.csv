More than simply decorating the side of a building, architectural graphic design is critical to establishing the purpose of a space, the visitor’s place within it, and helping to shape the overall experience. Architectural graphic design is about creating a vocabulary of design elements that reinforces the architecture and helps define the context for a place that people will connect with. Subtleties in design can have a huge impact. A different typeface can completely change the vibe of a place. A well-placed bench can bring moments of comfort. A cool graphic can inspire selfies in the parking lot. These are the emotional connections that drive people, the unconscious aspects that create resonance and transform a visit into an experience. The creative work of RSM Design is the transformative process that turns bricks, glass, steel, and concrete into a place with soul and style. We create places for people to linger, we guide them to new destinations, we facilitate shared experiences. Design is more than an aesthetic overlay and goes beyond making environmental elements look good to express the essence of a place and profoundly connect it to the people that will inhabit and visit the place. The work of RSM Design lives at the intersection of the grandeur of architecture.","A collaborative effort by the RSM Design team, past & present",Hardcover,274,1.74,https://www.visualprofilebooks.com/products/rsm-design-graphic-connections-in-architecture,https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Connections-Architecture-RSM-Design/dp/1733064877,"<figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/602ee5e0e1d59c2396a92409_n02_RSM-Design_Book-Page.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/602ee60dcfc371781e8821a4_n03_RSM-Design_Book-Page.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3500px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eec789d24d891b6d1d15438/602ee613ce131e151f3ed425_n04_RSM-Design_Book-Page.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><h3><strong>About the Authors</strong></h3><p>Suzanne Redmond Schwartz and Martin Schwartz founded the San Clemente studio in 1997.
